While it appears there is one experimental vaccine capable of limiting Ebola fatalities, so far, no suitable drugs have been found to treat existing infections.
One cocktail of antibodies, namely ZMapp, initially showed promise in this area, but formal studies indicated that the benefit from this cocktail was less than the benefits sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, the drug ZMapp was used as a control standard, meaning that scientists established it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the message of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute necessity for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that is already quite common—but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal’s feathers were chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of feather evolution in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not contain a fully developed skeletal structure, called a “spine,” but possess other feather characteristics – such as ridges and micro-ridges – researchers concluded that the spine was likely a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests they weren’t used for flight, but rather for regulating body temperature or display. Researchers propose that although this tail belongs to a small dinosaur, the sample shows fully developed feathers, not a hatchling’s tail.
Researchers indicated that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the sample shows feathers of a fully grown bird, not downy feathers of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

As for the completed work, most of it is theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations that were recorded of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was searching for is attributed to tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way galaxy.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way attracts the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
Scientists have managed to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter affects it.
That theory clarifies that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in a halo-like formation, and is composed of small particles in large numbers.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a severe, drug-resistant form of tuberculosis, or what is known as (XDR-TB), in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new, changing form of the bacteria is "alarming and extremely terrifying due to the very high mortality rate."
Dr. Mol believes that some patients, including two hospital staff members, likely contracted the virus within the hospital.
Within one year, a person infected [with a disease] may infect between 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter’s identity, the voter places the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law organizes procedures with an unwelcome strictness.
Since 1409 AH (1989 CE), ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that only envelopes belonging to registered and authorized voters—and those officially delegated—are added.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, following specific procedures.

He resigned from his position and will be replaced in the cabinet by parliament member Eйд Davies. Parliament member Norman Lamb is expected to take over the Business Secretary role that Davies will be leaving.
They and their lawyer have a hearing appointment at Westminster Magistrates' Court on the 16th of Safar.
Among the casualties were Nicholas Alden, age twenty-five, and Zachary Kudipak, age twenty-one. Kudipak was the driver.
Edgar Figuerola sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
“Schneider” suffers from chronic pain, blindness in one eye, and has lost a portion of his skull—his face having been reconstructed with titanium—all of which occurred while the “Oka” weapon malfunctioned as it was aimed at the head of a fifth man.
Schneider testified via video link from an American air force base in his home country.
Following the Wednesday event, Carbaniado competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first race was a slalom, where she received a "did not finish" result in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors received the same result in this race.
In her other race – the giant slalom – she achieved tenth place in the women’s sitting class with a combined run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher, Hungarian Gyongyi Dani.
Four para-athletes failed to complete their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skaters did not achieve a ranking in the giant slalom race.
The Madhyapradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
And the Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Ghaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the presence of three people inside the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
But the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred has been temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from a red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh accused of murdering her son.
She is currently being held in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be questionable as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently, and the courts have considered publishing the images potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are certainly heading down a dangerous path if they publish photos or similar material concerning suspects."
The Attorney General's Office indicated to journalists that there would be no further comments until at least an indictment is issued.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics that were reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a significant issue for both peoples, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands continued military presence in the Jordan Valley for a period of ten years, once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to the continuation of this presence for only five years.
The guards should have closely supervised the released individuals during the supplemental pest control experiment, as the experiment was under observation and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Service" and the "Australian Sporting Shooters’ Association," qualified volunteers were selected within the framework of the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of the NPWS Parks and Heritage Conservation organization, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday before a new temporary electoral council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth interim electoral council for Martilli in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the temporary electoral council as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee served as a retaliatory measure against the widespread anti-regime protests that began in Shawwal.
Protests erupted, sometimes violently, due to the failure to hold elections that were originally scheduled for 1432 AH.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in “iPod” devices have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported an additional 34 incidents of compromises, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded to Apple’s request to postpone the report by saying, “Truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (12:19 AM Mecca time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management stated that no damage was reported in the country.
As stated by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there are no indications of a potential tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired from his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later gave up their place to an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom, and Mendoza was shot.
He followed in his father’s footsteps and took up medicine as a profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then began working at Auckland National Women’s Hospital in 1379 AH.
"Layginz" began investigating premature births in his spare time while working at the hospital.
He demonstrated through his research that administering a certain hormone accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered flight recorders, also known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
The colleagues, the wrestlers, also praised Luna.
Tomi Dreamer said: “Luna was the first extreme queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong, unique woman.”
Dustin "Golddust" Ranzales commented, saying: “Luna was as eccentric as I was… and perhaps even more so… I loved her and will miss her… I hope she’s in a better place.”
Among 1,400 people surveyed in a pre-federal election poll in 1431 AH, the proportion opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 1429 AH.
During the federal election campaign of 1431 AH, the interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of those surveyed agree with this viewpoint and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the opposing sides in the poll, 29% of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never be a republic.
The fitness of the Olympic gold medalist is now in doubt due to his complaining, as he was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three legs in the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the necessary medication to overcome the pain as its use is prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on Muharram 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various devices and software starting in the month of Safar, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source of delivering water to Earth alongside organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and specifically how Earth formed from ancient impacts of comets.
Governor Como, 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
He is likely to run for president in 2016 (1437 AH).
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims will allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, as well as save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It utilizes a technology linked to satellites, unlike the old technology that used ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to pinpoint the location of an aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more specific information.
There will be no additional transportation options, and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, in addition to parking and park-and-ride facilities being unavailable.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the match being played behind closed doors, without any team supporters present.
A study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported on the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the evolution of new species took only two generations – despite the belief that this process takes much longer – due to interbreeding between the Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, the cactus finch, and the large cactus finch.
Gold can be shaped into various forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
And it can be drawn into a thin wire that can be coiled and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. And it could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
It is called the pH number of the chemical substance, and you can make an indicator for this number using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the substance is.
The level of pH is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry powders together, then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange sensation and forming a sort of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet mechanism in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the homes of the cities of Minwan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women frequented them together in a mixed setting.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It would take a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to put a satellite or telescope into space.
Changing the wheel transformed the world in an amazing way; but making transportation easier and faster remains its most significant contribution for us.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport brought us here.
There are more medium-sized cats in the rank below them that feed on medium-sized prey ranging between rabbits, gazelles, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success lies in the concept of niche, a specific function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Black cats are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three adult males, in addition to up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closer to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pride operates like a wolf or dog pack, and surprisingly, these animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very deadly to their prey.
As a comprehensively athletic animal, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The leopard belongs to the same group (the panther genus) as lions, tigers, and jaguars. These four are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the lion’s full-throated roar, but it’s closer to a shout with angry words.
Dwarf leopards love to eat small animals; they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that a dwarf leopard hunts are smaller in size than itself.
Scientists believe that sand cats track and locate animals they eat (prey) using their sense of smell; they smell where they were on the ground.
She can see well in the dark using night vision, and move with extreme stealth as well. Dwarf leopard cats hunt their prey by camouflaging with their surroundings then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small number of individuals) becomes isolated from the main population they belong to (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they previously inhabited.
Given the new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different characteristics or ways to adapt in order to become a stronger competitor than it needed to be previously.
There has been absolutely no change to the indigenous population at all; they still rely on the same coping mechanisms we’re accustomed to seeing from them.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, their similarity to other populations gradually decreases.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that we can no longer call them the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breath out).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants as well. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The *Mosasaurus* was the dominant predatory dinosaur of its time, so it feared nothing except other *Mosasaurus* individuals.
Its long canines were studded with more than 70 blade-like teeth, in addition to another set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there’s no escape for anything that stands in its way.
We don't know for certain, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he was likely a carnivore.
She also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't match her.
While most of their food will be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual festive items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
There was another distinction: while the poor and women ate their food sitting on the floor, wealthy men preferred to hold banquets together where they reclined on their sides while having their meals.
It wasn't possible for ancient Roman meals to include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the god’s house.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to fulfill the gods' needs during celebrations and festivals.
Every temple has an open courtyard leading to a secluded sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes unique towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The summit of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house didn't hold much importance.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women used to cook in the courtyard; the shops were merely open counters facing the street. Stone was used in building the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was expensive.
Humans have inhabited Greenland sparsely. It is recounted in Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and when he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes used to live there previously.
There were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite each country being "Scandinavian."
If you've seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"The phrase 'Original Declaration of Independence, dated 18th of Jumada al-Awwal, 1190 AH' is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence advertisement. The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted."
Although the author of this section of the text is unknown specifically, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it's likely the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings on that fateful day and the subsequent battles led to the liberation of northern France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
He ruled over Vichy France. These are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1359 AH and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 Sha'ban 1359 AH, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is a shared, individual culture among a large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, as a community.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, and relates to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and this also defines it as a societal mass.
Self-governing cities are the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implicitly means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Minor cultures often fade away without leaving any tangible historical evidence and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked any power to enforce taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were largely uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, you do not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs imposed between states.
The required materials were unanimously approved by all states before being amended, and the states mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 1427 AH (corresponding to 2006 AD).
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands owned by Japan, Japan is often – from a geographical perspective – referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan began its return to prominence in the fifteenth century, as sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1033 AH (1623 CE), the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began altering indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1094 AH, the armies of the Qing dynasty (1053-1330 AH) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1302 AH.
In 1312 AH, and following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1311 AH and 1312 AH, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it relinquished its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1364 AH.
Machu Picchu city consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings located on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By the year 1396 AH, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Its production is still ongoing to this day, but more importantly, the image sensor aspect ratio in digital cameras has inherited its proportions.
The 35mm format is a bit confusing, actually; it’s 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this image (when divided by 12 to get the ratio to the simplest whole number) will be 3:2.
It matches or closely approximates many common formats (such as a suite of advanced image system formats) this aspect ratio.
The much-misused and often-mocked rule of thirds actually constitutes a simple guiding principle that creates dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in a clear visual form.
It is said that the most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity linked the European nations together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power she possessed affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
Among the core Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church’s monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church in Rome existed for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question how faithfully it adhered to the requirements of doctrine.
Britain quickly imposed a naval blockade on Germany after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved its effectiveness – cutting off vital military and civilian supplies – despite this siege violating internationally accepted law, as codified and coordinated in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has effectively mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering vast areas of the oceans, which threatens even neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its own policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were peacefulness and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In the year 1301 AH, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different periods of time; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was of a different type.
In addition to that, between each ruling dynasty there was an era of instability and fragmented provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting for a seat at the top in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political repercussions, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from autocracy to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just the ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army, because instead of the army’s classifications being based on class, they now depend on calibers.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as “Hira” above Mount “Noor” for contemplation.
The cave presents itself, having remained throughout the ages, as a very vivid image of the Prophet Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and it is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it’s not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you become completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen but the beautiful clear sky above the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century of the current era, the Great Pyramid is considered one of the massive pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" including the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "string up" sign looks like the letter V, and the "string down" sign looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
An upper mark indicates that you must start from the tip and push the bow, while a lower mark means you must start from the end of the bow (where your hand holds it) and pull it.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to mark your own indications in pencil, but remember that the printed curved markings are there for a musical reason, and should therefore usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis Charles, age four), along with the King’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on the 17th of Muharram, 1204 AH, to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a large crowd of people shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of people managed to force the King and Queen to open the windows of their car wide open.
At some point, one of the gang members waved the head of one of the slain Royal Guards in front of the horrified Queen at Versailles.
The Filipino people bore the costs of the United States' imperialist war during its invasion of the Philippines.
These individuals were compelled to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through banking houses and Wall Street.
Naturally, the exorbitant profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will constitute the primary gains of American imperialism.
We must understand the motivating context for the organization’s creation, in order to comprehend the Knights Templar.
The era in which those events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (390-700 AH).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, all of which collectively ended around 893 AH.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological necessity to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two common ideas shared in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a largely independent path, transcending cultural or political influence, and that this technology, in turn, has “effects” on societies that are inherent to it, rather than being socially constructed.
For example, one might say that the car engine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, building a road network across the country is not economically feasible for a handful of cars, so new ways are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Collective car ownership also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, which in turn drives innovation in healthcare technologies to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose; and these people, being in harmony with their community’s place, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 493 AH.
Her status declined during the twelfth century primarily because the Crusades returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
And at this time, Paris was given the title of "fashion capital" instead of Constantinople.
Gothic architecture reached its peak between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
Despite that, due to the slow pace of communication channels, trends in the West may lag by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time, as a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the cultivation done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family only.
Kaff cultivation – often organic – is considered a simple system that utilizes stored seeds suited to the region’s ecosystem, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, with the goal of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers have practiced subsistence farming, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar thinking and those who feel marginalized due to societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are likely to be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
Perhaps the characteristics that define the distinction of a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures signal their affiliation through the diverse and symbolic use of style, which includes clothing, behavior, and dialect.
Among the most common approaches used to illustrate the importance of socialization is relying on the unfortunate cases of children who suffered from neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, and who were not socially connected to adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "the feral ones" or similar. Some lost children were confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to parents' rejection of the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Children with disabilities may have experienced abuse or severe trauma during childhood before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; it is said that some lived in the wilderness alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limitations) that closely resemble those of the animal caregiver, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes beyond that.
Interactive learning isn’t a method of learning, but rather a support tool that provides assistance to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and in-person, and in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paperclip guy in Microsoft Office.
The program natively supports interactive learning and aims to pose questions, motivate, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment lacking upbringing, care, and education, but they do.
We understand that the alternative care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our adoption care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care should provide all the necessities they lost in the homes they previously left.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to usage and methods of fulfillment.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Emy and McCord (1998) when they studied public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements that last for just fractions of a second.
It is specifically claimed that one can discern whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sacks mentioned in his paper that the President's speech suggests that people unable to understand language due to brain damage are able to assess truthfulness accurately.
In fact, he proposes the idea that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared with some animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century clarified the existence of two groups of genetic variations: one hidden and one apparent.
The mutation adds new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
The separation and recombination operations work to make the disparity randomized, back and forth, between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will lead to dire consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The readily available plant resources were abundant proteins obtainable from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide protein in high quantities and contain all essential amino acids.
Considering all things, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the deliberate waking up during your normal sleep period and then falling back asleep after a short period (from 10 to 60 minutes).
And this can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which forces you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on biological systems, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less stress there is, the more positivity life’s force grants. Every person has the inherent ability to find complete peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment. The only thing holding us back on the path to this goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces everyone.
"Kundalini" energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. Through visualizing the different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, but with the end of the war, a clash of systems, measures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies have become enemies now, and the Cold War has begun.
This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, with fighting on the ground, through proxy armies, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By the 17th of Ramadan in 1358 AH, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most effective method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Tradition dictates that the function of naval forces is to ensure your country’s ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously, intercepting the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where the Americans attempted to transport personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean in order to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, and its mainstay in doing so was the use of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany likely would have been able to invade Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began preserving them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, much like the widely known shepherd. These grazing practices are still used today.
Cart tracks were established in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite the fact that the old railway cars consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them at greater speeds and haul larger loads compared to the roads, which were considered very rough at the time.
Railroad ties were invented relatively early to secure the tracks, but it later became clear that placing a steel rail on top of the track made it more effective.
And it became a customary practice, however, iron led to more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1181 AH, the first complete iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first means of transportation; humans began walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning 'upright man').
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright steadily.
Footprints of two-legged creatures were found in Australopithecus excavations dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems, and we must eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed drastically due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have grown larger due to population increase and the luxurious lifestyle of people.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a short distance between buildings to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
And throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Donlap's critical bulletins."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on the eighth of Rajab.
One of them was sent to George Washington on the sixth of Rajab, and he read it to his forces in New York on the ninth of Rajab. A copy of it arrived in London on the tenth of Sha'ban.
The twenty-five Donlap broadsides represent the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
They often think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
It has feet with layers of external protection and claws, lays eggs, and walks on its hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
All computers used today rely by default on processing information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary digits – or bits, if we use the conventional language of computing.
Internal poisoning may not show symptoms immediately. A quick diagnosis cannot be based on symptoms like vomiting, which are common enough.
The best indicator of poisoning might be finding an open container of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label to learn about the first aid instructions specific to the poison.
Entomologists use the term "bed bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that have highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both “bed bugs” and “kissing bugs” are characterized by a long incubation period, and they adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young people and adults of middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to be affected by multiple sclerosis compared to males.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to have an adoption plan for their children.
As part of the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through a scientific methodology. This methodology, in fact, guides most scientific research.
However, she is not unique in this regard; experimentation and experience are considered a test that can be used to disprove one or more potential hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often critically depend on the existence of cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which aren’t merely responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Use Hershey and Chase’s phages or viruses to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two labeling experiments, either marking the phage nucleic acid using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a diverse range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about this type of ape (orangutans) in Borneo.
People leave the small towns in their cars every morning to go to their workplaces, and on the way they encounter others who work in the place they just left.
In this vibrant transportation system, everyone relies on and is somewhat connected to a network based on private cars.
The science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation systems, yet everyone complains about the transportation systems.
You rarely hear comparable levels of complaints in developed countries about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate complaints like these, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it’s impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave with a reasonably consistent pattern; therefore, traffic flow enjoys reasonable consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better clarify the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three key properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings backwards along the length of their bodies.
This gives them a larger set of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings today are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don’t feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 6 miles at times.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the continuation of building stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and artistic excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their ancestors, which had stood for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and has the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language of everyday life used by most state employees, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it was also assumed that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And of course, there are minerals like silver and gold as well.
You can also obtain ingots that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe was created from matter. All matter was created from tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can occupy the space of the dot at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without needing to use a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what keyboards might become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it gathers energy to form a nucleus filled with protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. The nucleus splits again, and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with minimal or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to emerge onto the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge spontaneously upon reaching adulthood.
These theories explore what makes some people want to do the things they do, and the things in their surrounding environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two common theories for content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin leading their former peers: one is an attempt to remain "like the others" (or other women).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the contrary, the individual transforms into someone unrecognizable, feeling they must change everything the team was doing and possessed.
Ultimately, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Team members in a virtual setting often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than members of traditional teams, as their teams may convene according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real “hidden team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) was described as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the “Invisible Team” management team, which sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that takes a long time? Innovation is considered one of the goals of applying institutional learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional departments within the organization, creativity and excellence can be achieved.
As a result, synergy within the organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the method of continuity as a way used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Data associated with neuroscience provides concrete evidence for the theoretical approach in investigating knowledge. This works to narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
It supports the connection between brain pathology and behavior for scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore the structures and processes of the brain in ways we have never experienced before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Despite the strong association of artificial intelligence with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and in addition, recognizing handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become distinct fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been used to build several software applications on home computers and video games.
Field trips are considered a large part of any semester. Often, the teacher may love to take her students to places that are considered unreachable by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips. Students can view artifacts at the museum, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Also, sharing a virtual field trip is a great way to revisit a specific trip and exchange experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Broughton High School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online as a record.
Furthermore, blogs can help improve students’ writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with imperfect grammar and spelling, having an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs "force students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed public interest inspires students to be excellent and beneficial (Tutu, 2004).
Journaling is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand the scope of learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can “enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through effective responses to materials online, students can identify their positions in the context of others’ writings as well as define their own opinions regarding specific issues (Oravik, 2002).”
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, home to a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Niagara Falls is located in the far south, and in the north lies the house of beautiful, untapped nature in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what foreigners consider to be the essence of Canada.
The large areas in the north are somewhat sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited.
By way of comparison to a population statistic that surprises many: the number of African Americans residing in the United States is greater than the total population of Canada.
The islands off the coast of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, opposite the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island ever, and it is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most small islands are independent states, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs carried Islam to the region, and it spread widely across the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Europe to India.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
Women: Regardless of their actual social status, traveling women should declare that they are married.
It’s worthwhile to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences may lead to what they might consider harassment, and that it is customary to monitor them, and restrain them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (don't let cultural differences make it acceptable!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used the site of modern Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa," after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1168 AH.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it Dar al-Badiya, while Spanish merchants, who established trading posts there, called it Dar al-Bayda (the White House).
Casablanca is among the least exciting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
It’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha pipes, and all sorts of cheap items, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In the year 1423 AH, Goma was destroyed by the lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of "Goma" should be investigated to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province, while "Goma" is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyragongo volcano and some of the most affordable ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can ride a boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Besides being relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for faraway, exotic lands.
The city of Timbuktu is currently a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and despite having an airport.
In 1411 AH (1991 CE), it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS series about the Wonders of the African World.
The city starkly contrasts with the rest of the cities in the country, as it is characterized by a more Arab than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, extending along the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and is bordered to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different environmental zones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is considered one of the attractive regions in South Africa, and is also a major park among South Africa's national parks (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee for the maintenance and entry to the park, consistent with all national parks in South Africa.
It might be useful to purchase a Wild Card; it allows you access to a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name, and it’s the place many tourists consider their first destination.
The aligned buildings that outline the Hong Kong skyline resemble a gleaming graph rising above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists took as their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the region’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the remote coastal areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest located within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not merely mangrove swamps; they hold some of the last remaining evidence of the dense jungles that once covered the Ganges River plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, roughly a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 CE, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and estimates indicate there are now 400 Bengal tigers, and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses leave the internal station between regions (across the river) throughout the day, although most of them, especially those heading east to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between neighborhoods are often crowded, it’s best to buy tickets in advance, a few days beforehand.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Coaster" buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Barwa (Nu 150) and Bunakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two tracks each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in Sha'ban 1432 AH, but it did not open to traffic until Rabi' al-Awwal 1438 AH.
The bridge is scheduled to begin operating at full capacity in Ramadan 1438 AH, coinciding with the expected completion of the Brazilian customs inspection points.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay; the Guarani lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay emerged – previously known as the "Giant Province of the Indies" – as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 943 AH, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year are held in Dhu al-Hijjah, on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
In addition to that, smaller tournaments and matches can be watched here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and find out where to buy polo match tickets, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value equal to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, on the other side of FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar is often accepted as well.
In remote areas, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency might be; check with the owners beforehand to find out accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you must exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical regions; temperatures commonly exceed 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Perhaps the winter is deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains relatively constant throughout the year, as there are no defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and a potential danger, and therefore they should be given their space.
In addition to that, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is the city of Apia. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1960 CE (1379 AH).
The harbor was the site of infamous naval clashes in 1306 AH when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and approximately 200 American and German people drowned.
During the struggle organized by the Mao movement for independence, the peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of Supreme Commander Tupoua Tamasisi Lylofi the Third.
Because "Auckland" is located between two harbors, there are many beaches, with the most popular ones located in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, allowing for safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by botocudo trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitematā Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches get crowded sometimes, but have a good selection of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The basic popular beer is known as "Number One," it's not a mixed drink, but rather an enjoyable and refreshing beverage. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many types of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines may have a wider reach/popularity.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you’re concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an "espresso," while a cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent, although they are expensive.
Many trips are organized to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reefs rarely occur for any of these reasons.
With that being said, seek advice from the authorities, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of latitude 1770, and can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles do not usually live in the ocean; their primary habitat is located in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A prior reservation reassures the traveler that they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their intended destination.
Although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with specific hotels.
It is customary for travel agents to offer packages that include breakfast, and arrangements for transportation to and from the airport, or even comprehensive packages including flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Despite that, any modifications or requests must be directed through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on-site, considering it an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you must arrive early in order to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there are sections of the festival that may continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals include dedicated camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea region in winter, you should check the cabin location, as passage through ice causes very loud noise for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include spending some time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually put a lot of effort into increasing the time and money guests spend there. Windows and clocks are often absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They have a habit of special meals, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep the guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages for free, but intoxication impairs sound judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
During snowstorms, a sufficient amount of snow may fall to stop you for a very short time.
Ice accumulation, blowing icy winds, condensation, or ice on car windows can all lead to limited visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Perhaps safari trips are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term "safari" is commonly used to refer to traveling across the country to view the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially in the savanna.

The Paralympic Games will be held from the 16th to the 28th of Muharram, 1443 AH, and some of the events will be held at secondary locations in various parts of Japan.
Following Tokyo's hosting of the Olympic Games in 1383 AH, the city will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 1441 AH before the postponement was announced, you might face an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but starting from late Rabi' al-Awwal, most cancellation policies based on coronavirus were no longer in effect until Rajab 1441 AH, when the Olympic Games were originally scheduled to be held.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while the cost of a typical regular ticket will be around 7,000 yen.
Helping to iron wet clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer an iron and ironing board to borrow, even if they aren’t in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't prefer wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a clothes dryer, if one is available.
Don't let the fabric get too hot (which could cause it to shrink or, at worst, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in other areas it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness; if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in bottles sealed tightly from a reputable company.
Travelers are likely to encounter pests they are unfamiliar with from their original regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause annoyance, or trigger allergic reactions in the worst cases, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Even contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people forcefully, are not usually described as plagues.
Shopping in the duty-free market is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and fees in designated locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can, at times, save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Pittsburgh-Buffalo highway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow passages, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than they were in previous and subsequent sections—typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/hour)—and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
It's strange that mobile service seems stronger here than in many other areas along the way, for example, the forests of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and diverse, resembling the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into pastries throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often enjoyed specifically with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try what’s known as a Berliner, Vanuchkin, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Kari is a dish made of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry powder can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, the use of yogurt in curry is widespread, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, the use of coconut milk is common.
Indonesian food represents an umbrella term encompassing a large collection of regional cuisines spread throughout the Indonesian archipelago, due to the existence of 17,000 islands in Indonesia that differentiate them.
However, if used without additional terminology, the term tends to mean that the food originates from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply spiced dishes, with the dominant flavors preferred by Javanese people being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are considered supports for the rider’s feet, hanging down on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider, but can have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If a rider falls from a horse but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged if the horse runs away. There are a number of precautions that can be taken to mitigate that risk.
Firstly, most horsemen wear riding boots with a very narrow, soft-soled heel.
Secondly, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the rider’s thighs to fall away from the saddle when pulled back during dismounting.
Wadi Kushamo – the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as the “Yosemite of South America,” with a diverse collection of walls and massive granite formations.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes between the endless potential cliffs, whose summits include breathtaking views from above.
Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and ice skating, are popular sports that involve sliding down a patch of snow-covered ground using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is considered a major activity during travel and has a large number of enthusiasts, who are sometimes known as "ski bums," as they plan entire vacations centered around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The history of downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1278 AH, the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ice hiking/snowshoeing.
It is associated with Alpine ski touring or mountaineering, but it doesn't usually involve ski touring or mountaineering, as those are practiced on very steep terrain and require more rigid skis and tall boots.
Think of an ice skating trail as being similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover longer distances than walking, but you’ll rarely reach long-distance skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it contains many independent countries. And under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means you are forced to go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
Despite that, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a single state in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the border without needing to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for entry visas to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define antiques as goods over one hundred years old, but there is no comprehensive definition of what we consider antiques among manufactured items.
To explain geographical differences, as the lifespan may be shorter in places like North America than it is in Europe.
Handicraft products may be regarded as antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods from the distant past.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professionals.
Even traditionally, despite that, not all Sami peoples participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing and hunting and the like, and mostly used reindeer as draught animals.
Many Sami people work in modern crafts today, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite the widespread use of the word "ghajar" – especially among non-Roma – it is considered an offensive term due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice from those governments is specifically tailored for their citizens.
To give one example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that differ from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are merely a summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often quick, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that may cause serious damage or social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it depending on the geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Severe winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic phenomena include: snowstorms, icy storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with any risks of severe weather events in the places they visit, due to the impact this may have on their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must obtain professional training.
Searching online for "hostile environment awareness training" may lead to the website of a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail, and typically does so through practical experience.
The course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines that deal with wilderness survival, while publications addressing war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without mentioning gender (X) or to issue updated documents to reflect a desired name or gender identity.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
And searches at security checkpoints became far more intrusive on privacy in the post-9/11 era (corresponding to after Ramadan 11th, 1422 AH).
Transgender individuals before surgery should not be expected to go through scanners without maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the return flow from waves breaking on the shore, often near coral reefs or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow concentrates in a few deep sections, and a swift current may form towards the deep waters there.
Most deaths result from exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you swim against the current, the swim back will be no harder than usual.
Try to target a location where the current won’t control you again, or, depending on your skill and whether someone noticed your presence, waiting for rescue might be another option.
The shock of returning to the homeland hits faster than culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Sometimes, travelers who easily adapt to a new culture find it particularly difficult to readjust to their original culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your homeland's culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People might not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show pyramid is one of the most enjoyable things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and in silence before the show begins.
You can always usually hear the voices of tourists and vendors here. The sound and light show is like the story of a book.
The Sphinx was placed as a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1234 AH, are claimed by numerous countries, and they host more than a few research stations, with the number of active ones reaching 16 in 1441 AH.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which has a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
Among other places, Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the caldera, submerged by an active volcano, offers a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the Peninsula, and is bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the Arabian Peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the Ellsworth Mountains, which extend for 360 km, and are divided by the Minnesota Glacier River.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in the Antarctic continent, Vinson Massif, whose peak reaches the equivalent of 4892 meters, Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, with no cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones, as you must be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used via satellite, including leisure boats, as well as expeditionary missions that have remote data and voice needs.
It is necessary to have a local telephone service provider capable of providing more information about how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning are becoming a more popular option for those planning a gap year.
It’s particularly popular among those who have finished secondary school, as it allows them to spend a year before university without risking their education.
Often, enrolling in a year-long training course abroad can improve your chances of being accepted into higher education in your home country upon your return.
There are usually fees to register for those educational programs.
Finland is considered a wonderful destination for boating. “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” also contains thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the numbering goes from one to forty).
Most luxury Baltic cruises feature a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning and sleep on board the ship at night.
If you are traveling on coastal cruise excursions by ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 1430H).
Some tours feature the German city of Berlin in their brochures; however, as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea and the tour price does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't traveled before or have been through a traumatic incident.
It’s nothing to be ashamed of: it’s not much different from personal fears and other disliked things that many people have.
Understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight may help some people overcome the fear that stems from the unknown or from a lack of control.
Good sums of money are paid to shipping companies to deliver things quickly. Time is usually very important when it comes to business documents, goods, and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies own their private planes, on some airlines, but there was a problem for the other airlines and smaller companies.
If they send things by air freight, it might take several days on some routes for unloading and customs clearance.
Sending packages as luggage, subject to inspection, was the only way to receive them quickly, but domestic airline regulations don't allow sending luggage without a passenger, so this is where you come in.
The most straightforward way to travel in first or business class is to allocate a significant amount of money to secure this privilege (or it’s better to have your company cover it).
However, this doesn’t come cheap: as a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy fare for businesses, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, it's not worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Learn the airlines well; there's a key group of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In the year 1414 AH, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
And economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in "Moldova" is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

The ancient city of Smyrna was once, and is now a bustling, modern, and developed commercial center, located around a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by traditional red-tiled roofs, alongside an 18th-century souk, ancient mosques, and churches, although the city enjoys a more Mediterranean atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Hållandsvik offers views of the nearby island of Ekerö and contains a unique church with an octagonal design.
In the church courtyard, there are exquisite marble statues of doves above some graves.
It’s worth spending half an hour wandering around the interesting village.
The romantic city of Centra, with its breathtaking beauty, lies to the north in an easily accessible location, and it is the city whose fame spread among foreigners after Lord Byron’s magnificent account of its wonders.
The "Scooterb 403" bus travels regularly to "Sintra", stopping at "Cabo da Roca".
In addition to that, to the north you can visit the great shrine of Sayyida Fatima (a holy sanctuary), which is a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially in a mass grave site, in addition to it being a location with a meaning that is almost infinite to a huge portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time there, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, respect, and reverence it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by placing signs or offensive writings on the walls of buildings.
The city of Barcelona has two official languages: Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
And yet, most signage is expressed in Catalan, as it is legally considered the first official language.
Despite this, Spanish is commonly used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are broadcast only in Catalan, while unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The people of Paris are known for selfishness, rudeness, and arrogance.
The best way to get along in Paris is to behave with good manners like a “bien élevé” person – that is, well-bred – although it usually boils down to a false stereotype.
The superficial Parisian parts will evaporate quickly if you offer some basic flattery.
Dense forests fill Plitvice Lakes National Park, primarily composed of beech, fir, and spruce trees, and it is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It possesses a large and diverse collection of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The region also harbors a highly diverse array of animal and bird breeds.
There, one can find animals of rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and the Caucasian grouse, alongside many other more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide a headscarf for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this from the storage room at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after every use, which is why you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, relies on bread, vegetables, and meats (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
"Bread with olive oil" is considered an example of a simple, popular supper, especially during the summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available seasonings such as: cheese, tuna, and the like.
All names, in addition to the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters we should watch out for are c and g, because their pronunciation differs based on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce ر and رّ differently: Karo means beloved, while Karro means a cart.
The Persian language has relatively easy and often familiar rules.
Therefore, reading this grammatical introduction will help you learn more about Persian grammar and understand phrases better.
And certainly, your knowledge of a Romance language will make learning Portuguese easier for you.
However, those with even a little knowledge of Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to Spanish as to not warrant studying it separately.
Older observatories are usually not suitable for modern use, and remain as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution wasn't one of their major concerns as it is these days, they usually resided in cities or university campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms – known as *hanami* – has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the most popular.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other members of the noble class around the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when left in their natural environment, so resist the urge to pick them, even if it’s just “one” sample.
When visiting a formally landscaped garden, collecting "samples" will also get you kicked out, no questions asked.
Generally, Singapore is considered a very safe place and extremely easy to get around, and a place where you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, due to its location “close to the tropics”—only a few degrees north of the equator—you need to deal with both: consistent high heat and scorching sun (which is rarely the case when the sky is clear).
There are also a few buses heading north to the city of Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs "Abraham," "Isaac," and "Jacob," and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland canals could be a good idea to base a vacation around.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a river cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
Inland waterways also define common routes for walking and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Christ.
Just as non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions surrounding holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake all night on Easter until its end in an open place to watch the sunrise.
This tradition can certainly be interpreted from a Christian theological perspective, but there's a possibility it was a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter Eve prayer service on Saturday during Easter weekend, and gatherings frequently begin celebrating the resurrection of the Lord Christ when midnight arrives.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying, or floating.
And due to the distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That provides a good opportunity to see the aurora, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is unlikely to be a problem, you will also be able to enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
Thobes are traditional work attire, and colleagues address each other by their family names or job titles.
