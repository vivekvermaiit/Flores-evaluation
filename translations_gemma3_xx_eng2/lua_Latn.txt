This is a difficult sentence, rich in cultural context and figurative language. Here's a translation attempting to capture both meaning and nuance: “Truly, a good life is a beautiful journey, and concerning Vital and the people who came to help us with the building, may their memories be honored with the aroma of cooked food offered to their mothers, and may their stories be told with the wealth of proverbs.” **Explanation of choices & difficulties:** * **"Ne budimu budi buleja bulelela"**: This is a very poetic opening. "Budimu" is life, but carries connotations of goodness and well-being. "Buleja bulelela" describes a beautiful, flowing journey. * **"Kumpushabu basalayi ba Vital ne bantu batuadija kutua mpanda"**: This refers to Vital and those who assisted in building (likely a house or community structure). "Kumpushabu" introduces the topic of remembrance. * **"Panyima pa dipangadika edi dia kukanga jila wa pamayi wakalela tshinyangu pa meyi ne mikandu ya ditunga."**: This is the most complex part. It’s a blessing or expression of honor. "Dipangadika" refers to offerings, specifically food. "Jila" is food, and "pamayi" is mother. The idea is that the memory of these people will be honored as sweetly and richly as food prepared for a mother, accompanied by the wisdom of proverbs (“mikandu ya ditunga”). "Tshinyangu pa meyi" refers to telling stories. It's important to note that a *perfect* translation is impossible without deep cultural understanding and further context. This translation prioritizes conveying the sentiment and poetic nature of the original Luba-Kasai sentence.

This is a difficult sentence, heavily reliant on context and potentially containing idiomatic expressions. However, based on Luba-Kasai grammar and vocabulary, here's a translation aiming for accuracy while acknowledging potential nuance loss: **"He/She brought a child, and the children – those children who understand the traditions of their parents and the customs of their fathers – greatly cherish the child."** **Explanation of key elements & choices:** * **Mu diagata dia muana:** "He/She brought a child" - *diagata* means to bring, *muana* is child. *dia* functions as a preposition indicating what was brought. * **baledi ba muana:** "the children" – *baledi* means children. *ba muana* modifies ‘children’ likely referring to a specific group or a generational connection. * **badi bimanyikija bukokeshi bua buledi buabu bua baledi bakuabu:** This is the core of the complexity. It essentially means "those who understand the traditions of their parents and the customs of their fathers". *bimanyikija* is to understand, *bukokeshi* refers to tradition, *buledi buabu* are parents, *baledi bakuabu* are fathers/ancestors and *bua* is a possessive marker linking them. * **bangata muana:** "greatly cherish the child" - *bangata* means to cherish or love greatly, *muana* is child.

"To" indicates a specific location, contextually understood. * **"dipima"**: "We will be tested." This implies a trial or assessment. * **"ne dipima ndi teta didi bu benzela mua kumbusha tshipiminu tshimua eshi bia bunyi"**: This is the core, complex part. It translates roughly to "and this test is a small thing because of the burden of remembering the past that weighs heavily." "Tshipiminu tshimua eshi bia bunyi" describes the past as a weight or burden. "Benzela mua kumbusha" - the act of remembering is the source of this weight. * **"kuela makonka"**: "especially" or "particularly." * **"ne ku tangila bitu abi bilombola ngebululu wa bena dimanya"**: "and concerning the mistakes and the consequences suffered by our ancestors.” "Bena dimanya" refers to ancestors. "Bilombola" signifies consequences or suffering. “Bitu abi” denotes the specific errors or failings. It's important to note that Luba-Kasai often uses proverbs and indirect speech. This translation prioritizes conveying the overall *meaning* and *feeling* of the sentence rather than a strictly word-for-word rendering.

"Tshilejelu" relates to forgiveness or reconciliation. "Pa" negates it, meaning there *is no* forgiveness, or a situation where forgiveness isn't possible. * **"miaba ya midimu mipiamiia"**: "Miaba" means spirits/ancestors. "Midimu" is also spirits/ancestors. "Mipiamiia" implies they are angry, displeased, or demanding. * **"kumana nyama ne bikela ne nyunyi"**: "Kumana" indicates 'to demand'. "Nyama" is meat, "bikela" is salt, and "nyunyi" is offerings/gifts. * **"kumuna malaba mapia ne miaba idibu ba muna bifukibua bia nyama"**: "Malaba" can mean trees, posts, or supports - likely ritual posts. "Mapia" means strong or important. “Idibu” means large or prominent. “Bifukibua” are packages or bundles. This part speaks to adorning these posts with meat offerings. * **"kumuna mishindu ya kubilonga ne kulonga ngumu mimpe buabualu buabi"**: “Mishindu” means words/speech. "Kubilonga" means to speak respectfully. "Kulonga ngumu" means to make strong pronouncements/declarations. "Buabualu buabi" means blessings or prosperity. It's important to remember that without wider context, this translation is an educated interpretation. Luba-Kasai often relies heavily on cultural understanding and implied meaning.
