These are often ceremonial or for celebrations. * **بارانجاهن (Baranjahan):** "Celebration" or "feast." * **تو ڬانل بانر (Tu janl banar):** "Intended for," "for the purpose of," or "meant for."

"Wade" means "this" or "it". "Padalman" translates to "waste" or "uselessness," often referring to money. So, "This is a waste…" * **نڠ کددا جڠکوان تليفون (ng kada jangkauan telepon):** “Ng” is a common Banjar particle, “kada” means “don’t” or “not”. "Jangkauan" means "reach," "coverage," or "connection" (specifically in the context of signals). "Telepon" is "phone." So, “Don’t waste your phone connection/credit." * **تليفون ستىليت بيسا جدي سببوتيڠنڽ فيليهن (telepon satelit bisa jadi sababu tingnya pilehan):** “Satelit” is satellite. “Bisa jadi” means “could be”. "Sababu" means "reason". "Tingnya" is tricky - it's a contracted form of "tinggalnya" which roughly translates to "its remaining/loss of". "Pilehan" relates to "pulse" (in older contexts referring to phone line signals) or "connection".
