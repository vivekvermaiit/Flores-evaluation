This confirms that scientists now believe dinosaurs had feathers, a still common theory, and it gives details that fossils generally can’t provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
And the scientists have said that the feathers of this animal are maroon-chestnut on the upper part with a white or carrottop-colored underside.
The discovery also provides information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The dinosaurs’ feathers didn’t have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they did have other feather characteristics, barbs and barbules, and researchers have deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development that came after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flying, but rather for regulating or visualizing temperature. Researchers have suggested that, even if this is the nest of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the feathers of an adult and not the down of a juvenile.

Cyanuric acid and melamine have been found in urine samples from domestic animals that died after consuming contaminated animal feed.
And the researcher at the university told me that the two compounds react and somehow come together to form crystals that can block the activity of the kidneys.
The researchers have observed that crystals are formed in the urine of cats due to the joining of melanima and cyanuric acid.
The composition of the crystals is the same as those I found in the urine of dead animals when they were analyzed with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
Even if you don't understand it, most products from Central America enter the country without duties.
However, eighty percent of the products there have been taxed with the tariffs in the countries of Central America. That’s treatment.
This work that seemed to me to have no sense, surely it wasn't right.
I said to the people that they treat me the way you treat them.
The California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The law proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with a sticker bearing the inscription “18” and that their sale to a minor be punishable by a fine of $1000 per offense.
The director of public prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, released a statement this morning announcing the charges against Huhne and Pryce.
He has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by Ed Davey MP. The parliamentarian Norman Lamb is expected to take over the post of Minister for Affairs that Davey is about to leave.
Hugh and Pryce are to appear in the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to the arm and cheeks, and Kristoffer Schneider had to request reconstructive surgery on his face.
The weapon of Uka failed miserably when aimed at the head of a small man. Schneider always has a pain, blind in one eye, a section of his skull is missing and a jaw reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider claims to have testified with a video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
Their first race was the Slalom, where she obtained a Did Not Finish in her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
The overall ranking in the Giant Slalom saw her slip to tenth position in the women's group in the seated category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who came in ninth place.
Four skiers from the women's group were sitting when they were not allowed to provide their excuses, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom were not allowed to qualify in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The chief inspector general DK Arya has declared: “We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
And the accused are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendant appeared in court with a fractured face.
Seven people were inside when the car crashed into the house, but no one was hurt.
But the one who was driving the car suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a good period of time while emergency services freed the man driving the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
That Adekoya was in the court of the sheriff of Edinburgh accused of having violated his son.
He is in protective custody while the accusation and trial are being investigated, but all eyewitness evidence could be compromised because his image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other places in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists are walking a dangerous path if they publish photographs or things like those of the suspects."
The Crown Office, which is the general body responsible for prosecution, has told journalists that no further statements will be issued until the indictment.
The document, according to news reports, will discuss the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Following what has been reported, other discussed topics include the future of Jerusalem, a sacred city for all nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a constant military presence in the valley for ten years, even when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to that military presence only for a period of just five years.
The shooter of the supplementary test for the control of pests and the hives must be controlled by the rangers, because the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited, within the scope of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
Second Mick O'Flynn, interim director for conservation and heritage of the NPWS park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received safety instructions and completed training.
Martelly has sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
He is the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
The commission presidentially appointed has recommended the dismissal of the head of the electoral commission as part of a package of measures to return the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the anti-regime protests that swept the country starting in October.
I protest, due to such violent acts, to the men who emerged from the lack of elections, a shameful expectation since 2011.
And the health authorities have reported around 60 cases of overheating iPods that don't work properly, a problem that has caused six fires in total and left four people with serious burns.
The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has declared knowledge of 27 incidents regarding the devices.
Last week, the METI announced to have informed Apple of another 34 incidents regarding overheating, which the company defined as “not serious.”
The minister called Apple’s decision to postpone the report “deeply regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM (09:19 GMT).
The agency responsible for emergency management has stated that no damage has been reported in the country.
They also said that the Tsunami Warning Center had stated there were no signs of a possible Tsunami.
A Filipino man who had also been a police officer hijacked a bus and held Hong Kong tourists hostage in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
They say the hostages are still being saved, even though for now they’re saying they’re dead.
These hostages, including the rich and the old, had already been released early. Together with them, the Filipino photographers were also released.
The photographer had positioned himself where an old woman had vacated the spot to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was then killed.
He was born close to his mother and father and he began a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Beneman, who worked in the hospital, Liggins had him investigate premature birth during his free time.
Her research has shown that the administration of a hormone could accelerate the maturation of the lungs of the fetal child.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators recovered two black boxes.
Even the wrestlers, his colleagues, paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two Moons. Rather unique, like she was there. A courageous woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels has commented that “Luna will die a silly death like me… perhaps even more so than me… I loved her and I will miss her… I hope she is in a better place.”
In a survey of 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who opposed Austria’s transformation into a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting prime minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Over 34 percent of the participants in the poll now share that idea and want Queen Elizabeth II to remain the head of state of Australia.
According to the latest poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Austria should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have competed in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to the fact that she was complaining about her physical condition, she is now in doubt.
He wasn't allowed to take the medicine that would have helped him overcome the pain because he had been banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people have verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comets could have been a way to bring water to the Earth together with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
And the scientists are hoping to understand how planets are formed, in particular how it happened on Earth, since comets have bombarded the Earth for a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the start of this year, and last month he signed a bill into law that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He/She has defined the words "political hypocrisy and stupidity."
It is hypothesized that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to land with shorter runways and save millions of liters of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
Now, thanks to satellite technology, the old technology that used ground-based radar is being replaced to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport has been arranged and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the park and ride parking structures will not be available at ground level.
Due to the lack of transport, there is a possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
And the researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take longer than the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic to the area (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
It can be used worked in all types of forms. It can be rolled into small, thin shapes.
It can be beaten until it becomes thin enough to make a fine thread, which can be twisted and drawn out. It can be hammered and rounded into sheets.
Gold can be beaten to become thin sheets and adhered to another metal. Gold can also be beaten so thin that it can be used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called “illuminated manuscripts”.
This is about the pH of a chemical substance. You can measure it with an indicator made with red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on whether the substance is acidic or basic (alkaline), the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
And the hydrogen ion is a proton that is a state stripped of an electron (since the hydrogen atom is made up of a proton and an electron).
Beat together dry and fresh flour, with clean hands, and form it into a ball.
The humidity in your hands will return with the outer layers, which you will feel uncomfortable and will make you shiver as if you have a cold.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Those that remain of many drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
And the origins of baths can also be found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When someone calls you from very far away, thousands of miles away, you need to use a satellite.
The satellites in space capture the signal and then reflect it almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
They needed a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The most important thing the wheel has done is not to make transport easier and faster.
When I take the train, the automobile and many other means of transport.
Under their voice they have a feeling of cutting more intermediate than the others animals, apart from the hares and the antelopes and the deer.
To finish, they have many small prey animals (including domestic cats living outdoors) that they maintain with the most numerous small animals like insects, mice, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of uniqueness, a special work that a cat has to do to allow it to see—not to compete with the others.
And the lions and the hens are beautiful birds, that live in large groups called nests.
The rose of lions is made of very fine thread, with at least thirty adult relatives and with a maximum of thirty females and children.
The women and the men should have kinship within their lineage and family, because they have a large family of sisters and daughters.
And the lions, they behave in a similar way to that of wolves, animals that they resemble quite a bit to lions (though they don't have the great claws) in their way of behaving, and can also be very dangerous for the animals that hunt them.
A strong, athletic man, the tiger is good at climbing (even if not well), swimming, jumping great distances, and pulling with a force five times greater than that of a powerful man.
The tiger is part of the same group (that is, the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines that we have are the ones that are good at roaring.
The roar of the tiger isn't like the roar at full voice of a lion, but it resembles more words growled and shouted.
And the ocelots, they like to hunt small animals. They eat rabbits, snakes, mice and birds if they can. Almost all the animals hunted by ocelots are much smaller than them.
And the scientists think that the ocelots wander around and find animals bigger than themselves, and they are born inside the animals that have always been on the train.
And the pumas can see well in the dark thanks to their nocturnal vision and can also move silently. And the ocelots camouflage themselves with what is around them to hunt the animals that eat and then jump on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from where they come (for example, if they move up the mountains or a river, or if they go to a new island in such a way that they can no longer return easily), they often find a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need to develop different characteristics or adaptations in order to be a strong competitor like those who left it behind in the environment they had.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it doesn't need new adjustments.
With time, good man, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to seem different from the other population.
In the past, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations appeared so different that they could easily be defined as distinct species.
That process which we call speciation, that is to say put in a simpler way, is the formation of new species. Speciation is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is an important part of the process of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that we need to breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans release.
Plants make their food with sunlight through photosynthesis and create shadows.
We notice the shadows on our houses and our clothes from the plants, the most beautiful part of the food we give to the green plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the strongest of all the dinosaurs and it wasn’t afraid of the others.
They are teeth, seventy beautiful ones and others within the roof of the mouth. You can't escape when it grabs you.
It’s possible he had a forked tongue. He ate turtles, fish, and possibly other mosasaurs if he was cannibalistic.
The dog would catch everything that reached to pull in the water, even a big dinosaur like the T-rex couldn't escape.
Even if the main part of their food would be known to us, the Romans were famed for their strange and unusual banquet dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a type of reddish fish called *gira*.
The main difference was that the poor people and women ate sitting down, while the gentlemen preferred to feast together and sprawl about meanwhile the diners ate their meals.
The meals of ancient Romans certainly didn't include food that had arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have cabbages, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and none of the Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians for each of their gods built a main temple, which was considered the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then a sanctuary inside where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Once upon a time, towers with special shapes like pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In that cultivated climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
The grand part of the Jewish family's life was outside.
The women used to eat in the courtyard; the shops were just stalls that opened onto the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was quite expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. It is said in Norse stories that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and when he had travelled west, he had found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even before they discovered it, the Eskimos already lived there at that time.
Even if every country was "Scandinavia", there were several differences between the people, the rulers, the traditions, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film National Treasure, you might think that hidden behind the Declaration of Independence there was marked a treasure map.
Everything he says is good talk, it’s not true. Although there are doodles written behind that document, it’s not a treasure map.
Below the words “Declaration of Independence original dated July 4, 1776” were written on the Declaration of Independence. The writing is on the back of the document, upside down.
Nobody knows for sure what was written on it, but it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was kept as a roll.
Therefore, it is possible that the notation was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed after the Allies liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was governed by the France of “Vichy”. These were French people who had reconciled with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies began entering southern France, and the invasion was named “Operation Dragoon.”
In two weeks, the forces of America and Free France were liberating the south of France and were heading to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, linked to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and it defines in a certain way also the dimension of society.
City-states were the precursors to nations. A culture of civilization implies the passage of knowledge between various generations, a cultural imprint that persists and a just dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and may not be recognized as true, proper civilizations.
Following the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government—Congress was the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to alter tax laws and tariffs between states.
The municipalities demanded unanimous consent from all states before being able to see changes, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often away.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are becoming more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international and Olympic games.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu) which makes it the seventh largest island in the world!
For the group of islands that Japan has, it is often indicated, geographically, as an "archipelago".
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company had established its base in southeastern Taiwan and had begun the transformation of fields from indigenous grain production and was employing Chinese labor to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in the west and north of Taiwan, and in 1885 it was declared Taiwan province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
The large part of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most popular image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of those analog films.
It’s still made today, but above all its aspect ratio has been inherited from the format of the sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format can cause confusion; it is 36mm wide and 24mm long.
The aspect ratio of its format (which must be divided by twenty times to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Several popular formats (like the APS format family) are either identical or very similar in this regard of appearance.
The much-abused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in the image.
She says that the most effective site for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, vertically and horizontally (see the examples).
In this epoch of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put on trial.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has brought together the countries of Europe despite differences in language and custom.
That power went everywhere and dominated the life of everyone, of rulers as of common citizens.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that alms should be used to help the poor and that the church's money should only be used for that reason.
The central authority of the Christian church is located in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to wonder if these principles were respected in the past.
Immediately after hostilities broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective and cut off military supplies and provisions for civilians, although this blockade violated internationally accepted laws codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain was laying mines in international waters to prevent all ships from entering certain sections of the ocean, and was also causing danger for neutral ships.
Given that there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the year 1900, the strongest movements among most cities and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid the same situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla had moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 40 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer’s manager) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each Chinese phase or family could have a distinctive dynasty.
Even between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Epoch of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, war raged between the many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died in the fighting to control the gate most often turned towards the grand palace of Xi’an.
There are several social and political effects like the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, and the most ambitious and successful ones could triumph.
It was the same for the soldiers because instead of classifying the army by class, now they were classified by caliber.
The French Revolution was also inspired by several other people from the working class from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond worldly life. He often frequented a cave that had become known as “Hira” on Mount “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
The very grotto, which had survived the times, gave a particularly vivid image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
It is situated on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it’s not easy to find it even if you knew it existed. Inside the cave, there’s total isolation.
One can see nothing but the beautiful clear sky above and the many mountains all around. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.
Built in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or “Giza Necropolis” in the Egyptian Valley of the dead has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and the other, smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the women and relatives of Khufu.
The sign for “arch up” looks like a V, while the sign for “arch down” looks like a graffito or a square without the lower side.
They want you to start with the tip and push the bow, and then they want you to start with the heel (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An arch played upwards creates a softer sound, whereas an arch played downwards creates a stronger and more decisive sound.
You can write your markings in pencil, but remember that the arcata markings are there for a musical reason, and therefore should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a crowd of market women.
Yesterday, they went to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were uttering threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage closed.
A member of the procession was quite startled before the exhausted queen, seeing the crack in the face of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of the imperialism of the United States for the conquest of the Philippines had been paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of its expenses and the interest on its floating debts in the name of the Filipino government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people were the basis of the gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which these events occurred is commonly called the Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Central Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression that brings together several ideas, from the drive for innovation or even the technological imperative, which in a strict sense would be thinking that the destiny of men is guided by a profound logic linked to scientific principles and their application within technology.
When discussing technological determinism, there are two main ideas: one that technological development doesn’t simply follow culture and politics, and the other that technology isn’t conditioned by society but manifests itself within it.
For example, you could say that the motorcar leads to the development of roads.
The roads of an entire country are expensive and they have to be exploited by a swarm of cars, therefore they thought about cutting the costs that people have to keep a car.
The more people have cars, the more accidents they have. Therefore, they have developed new healthcare technologies to help those people who need to be taken care of.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the environment of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and during that time traditions and cultures linked to that geography were born, and if they lived in harmony with their place in society, they were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that today Paris is the capital of world fashion, Constantinople was that of feudal Europe.
Her recognition as a center for prized products began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century above all because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were worth more than those that the Byzantine market could offer.
It was at that moment that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was at its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the wardrobe was profoundly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time was the result of the Crusades, and people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of its families.
Subsistence agriculture is simple, often organic, and it utilizes original seeds from the combined eco-region with crop rotation or other rather simple techniques to maximize the harvest.
In the past, the vast majority of peasants engaged in subsistence farming, a practice that still exists in several developing nations.
Subcultures bring together people who think alike and who feel overlooked by societal standards, and they allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging with a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take those few unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
These children are called “wild children”. This wild child was confined by people (usually his/her father and mother); in other cases, the abandonment of the child was caused because the father and mother rejected the heavy intellectual and physical limitations of the child.
Children who are severely neglected may have experienced significant childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised like animals; it is said that someone lived miserably like a wild beast.
When raised from childhood by non-human animals, the wild child demonstrates behaviors (with physical limitations) that are almost entirely comparable to those of the particular animal they live with, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
If the learning is based on projects, it should make learning easier and more interesting, the support system goes further.
The support system isn’t a method but rather a tool that provides support to those who encounter a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The support system can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of support but also the animated clip art in Microsoft Office.
The virtual support is within the software and is there to question, suggest, and explain those procedures that students might find difficult to manage on their own.
Children are often placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child ought to grow up in an environment that isn't protective, caring, and educational, but it happens.
Don't think that the trust system is a safe haven for these children.
Our system of values will ensure safety, reliable affection, stable education, and dependable healthcare.
He/She/It will see to providing everything that was missing in the house where they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to overuse and gratification.
For example, “to undertake” and “to socialize” are considered to be important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as motivational aspects when they researched public reaction to websites.
The detailed video recording led her to discover important insights in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is thought that it is possible to understand if a person is telling lies through the interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his writings, particularly in *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat*, suggested that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to measure sincerity with precision.
The suggestion arises that these abilities in interpreting human behavior could also be found in animals, like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: secondary and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mediate the variation forward and backward between the two pools of each generation.
In the savannah, for a primary consumer with a digestive system like that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy their need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Furthermore, the inability to do so had important consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant-based resources most easily available would have been the proteins from leaves and legumes, even though they are difficult to digest for beginners unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, eating insects (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest and also provides noble proteins which contain all the essential amino acids.
With a bit of luck, I wouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in roughly the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep immediately afterwards (10-60 minutes).
He can wake up easily with a rather quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without disturbing you at all.
If you happen to snooze your alarm when you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options are based on disrupting the circadian rhythm and drinking several liquids before sleeping (particularly water or tea, a famous diuretic), which oblige you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is, conversely, linked to the amount of tension within their body and spirit.
The less stress there is, the more positive the force of present life is. Every person has the potential to find peace and contentment always.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders our goal is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and the techniques of Indian yoga.
In its essence, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a feeling of love towards everyone and everything.
With such yoga, Kundalini, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) rises through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, and it led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the division of countries.
After two years from the end of the war, the old enemies were still there and the Free War began.
It lasted for 40 years and was fought fiercely by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already in ruins and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were disrupted almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Russian Army of the Soviet Union had entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is truly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the job of a sailor was to ensure that your country maintained the ability to move its people and its goods, and at the same time interfere with the ability of your enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most important recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At that very moment, the German navy, which primarily used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the raids had failed, it is probable that the Germans would have been able to conquer Great Britain as they had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that dogs were first domesticated 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to settle due to easy access to the lake, wool, meat, and hides.
Traditionally, domestic animals were kept in mountain pastures that moved around on the hills or in other grazing areas, often near goats that were herded or tethered, almost always by the most experienced shepherds. These methods are still used today.
Animal breeding systems had been developed in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the early traction systems for animals were mainly made of wooden rails, they allowed draft horses to travel faster and transport larger loads compared to the somewhat more uneven roads of that time.
The traverses had been invented quite early to keep the road workers in their place. However, little by little it became clear that the road workers would have been more efficient if they had been positioned on a layer of gravel.
This had become common practice, but the sand caused more wear to the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, the wooden wheels had been replaced by cast iron wheels. In 1767, the first railways entirely of cast iron had been introduced.
The first means of transport known is walking; humans began to walk straight two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (which means 'upright man').
The ancestors, Australopithecines, didn't walk upright as usual.
Evidence of bipedalism is found in fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it’s possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We could start living more respectfully of the environment, we could enter into an environmentalist movement and even become activists to reduce, to some extent, the future hardship.
In some cases, it’s truly like a symptomatic cure. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the technological and scientific progress of humans, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the kind of life original to humanity.
Following its adoption by the Congress on the 4th of July, a handwritten and signed copy of the Declaration by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a short distance away.
In the night, there were reportedly between 150 and 200 of them, now called “Dunlap’s mess”.
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on the 8th of July in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A letter was sent to George Washington on the 6th, which he read to his troops in New York on the 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 documents from Dunlap that were still known about, are the existing copies older than the document itself. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Some people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are so many birds that they still look like those from dinosaurs.
They walk with scales and claws, they make noise and walk on their two feet behind like a T-Rex.
Practically, all modern computers are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one or two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, to use the informational jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that it’s not possible to immediately perform an analysis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an empty medicine box or of toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The scientists say nonsense when they talk about small styles.
This name comes from the fleas that lived inside people's houses and bit them.
The foolish/silly people and then also those of milk, camp inside their nest or where they find a place to stay.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and it is therefore the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is the disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women have twice the probability of getting MS compared to men.
A foolish mother decides that raising a son is not in her interest or in the son’s interest.
These cousins should decide to make a plan for their son.
With adoption, the paddle and the natural mother relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides a large part of scientific research.
However, I am not discouraged because scientific research is also guided by experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, made with questions and observations.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions on every scientific question, including psychology, had been adopted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Certain rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often fundamentally linked to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which aren't simply responses to periodic signals from the outside, have been documented to a large extent as being present in living things like bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks have emerged so they can sustain themselves, continuing a free-running cycle even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase tricked the viruses to inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved are germline cells.
Mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism is based on nature, attracting people interested in visiting natural areas with the intent of enjoying the landscape, with plants and wild animals.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and gathering information about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to the place where they work and cross paths with those going to work towards the destination which is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is in some way connected and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Now science shows that this large carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
They all participate in society and use the transport systems. Almost all of them complain about the transport systems.
In developed towns, you hear rare levels of complaints about the quality of the water or about bridges that are falling down.
Why do the transport systems constantly receive such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are the transport engineers not competent? Or is something more fundamental happening here?
The study of traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
It’s unfortunate that the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
It's fortunate that the drivers tend to behave within a fairly constant interval; therefore, the flows of traffic tend to exhibit reasonable consistency and can be represented with mathematics.
To better understand the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are used in the planning, design and management of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
The vast majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings and return them along the length of their body.
This gives it a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot turn back to their former state are flies and mayflies.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Once upon a time, someone thought they were right, but other people believed the opposite – that the Solar System moved around the Earth, and also the Sun (and even other stars).
The priest is crazy, because he doesn’t feel that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width of six thousand in certain parts.
20 percent of the water that comes from the rivers of the planet that goes into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It takes water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size and in the technical perfection of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The City of Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the language used every day by those who work within the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because these could all be found in nature in original form and were rather easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, believed that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he thought they change into new substances to form what we don't see.
The alloys are mainly a mix of two or more metals. Don't forget that they have several elements from the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. It’s obvious that there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also find old laws with small amounts of elements that are not metallic, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of newer writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to go near a typewriter.
He was afraid to ask what would become of the furniture when he returned from the war.
The atomic bomb functions according to the principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It’s like pushing a heavy truck up a hill. If the nucleus were to split again, it would release some of that energy.
In this case, atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
They could smell old sulfur more strongly on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. It would have been easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
The theories of content are centered on the research of what motivates and pleases people.
These theories suggest that people have specific needs and/or desires that have been internalized through upbringing until becoming adults.
These theories concern what makes people want to do the things they want to do and what influences the actions of others in their environment, whether or not they carry out such actions.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that emerge when managers start to command their former colleagues. On one hand, there’s an attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or to joke around).
This type of manager has difficulty making tough decisions, taking disciplinary action, giving evaluations, assigning responsibility, and considering the people involved.
On the other hand, one becomes an unrecognizable person who feels old changing everything the team has done and making it their own.
In the end, the leader is fundamentally responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same quality standards as normal teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their physical group as well.
Often, they have more autonomy than normal team members because their teams can meet in different time zones that their local administration might not have understood.
The presence of an “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a characteristic of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the administration team to which every member reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why should an organization undertake the long journey of becoming a learning organization? An objective for putting learning organization concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are well used in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that satisfies the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical proof for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it decreases the area of research and makes it appear much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supported by the sciences in their research.
It has been known for some time that various types of brain damage – trauma, lesions, and tumors – influence behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The arrival of new technologies allows us to see and study the structures and processes of the brain that had never been seen before.
This provides several pieces of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes within our minds.
Even though Artificial Intelligence is strongly linked to science fiction, it forms a rather important part of computer science, and concerns intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
The research in Artificial Intelligence concerns the construction of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to analyses and client requests, and also the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These days, they’ve become separate entities, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is now often used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, because it has been implemented in several software applications of home computers and video games.
School trips to the countryside are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers a solution with journeys on the virtual field. Students can view the artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire superb works of art while they are sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip on the virtual field is also a perfect way to think about and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is updated, but older versions are kept online as a portfolio.
Even blogs can improve students’ writing. Even if students often begin their blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, a larger audience usually corrects the mistakes.
Given that students are often the most critical public, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid being criticized.
They started a blog, even “obliging students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The need to fuel public interest gives students the motivation to write more intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Running a blog is a tool that motivates collaboration, encouraging students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The judicious use of blogs can allow students to become more analytic and critical; through an active response to materials on the internet, students can define their own positions in the context of others' writing and also describe their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the marvelous capital of Canada where two languages are spoken and which has a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
To the south, there are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, it hosts the pure natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these ropes and many others define Ontario as what is typically considered Canadian forests.
Large areas further north are not too inhabited and in some of them it is almost uninhabited wild land.
For a comparison of the population that might surprise everyone: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa lie in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa.
When we talk about wild animals, Madagascar is the largest and is itself a continent.
The large part of the smaller islands are independent nations, or linked to France, and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it had a great diffusion in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism had begun in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama had discovered the route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended to all women who travel alone to declare themselves married, without considering their true marital status.
It's also useful to put on a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
The women in Duarese understood that cultural differences could result in what they considered harassment, and it’s not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
It's hard to return people from the refusal, and not an old habit of maintaining one's position (cultural differences or less, it doesn't go well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese were dismantling and rebuilding it with new materials under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan was having new cities built, like Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who were established there for commercial purposes.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
Returning to the old Medina, it’s easy to find places where they sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a great variety of slippers, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city within the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is located to the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying all its roads and its center.
The situation is quite safe, but if you go out it’s best to understand what’s happening in the North Kivu province, which is always at war.
From Goma, people start to climb Mount Nyiragongo, and it’s also one of the places where you can rarely see mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (a motorcycle that acts as a taxi) which, to reach a nearby place, will cost you 500 Congolese francs.
Although its actual location isn’t very accessible, “Timbuktu” is used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its name makes it a tourist attraction, and it has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
She was one of the main featured artists in Henry Louis Gates’s “Wonders of the African World” series distributed by PBS.
The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the cities in the country, because it already has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa, stretching along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park is large, 19,500 km², and is divided into 14 eco-zones, each of which protects different wild animals.
It is one of the major attractions of South Africa and is considered the pride of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like with all South African National Parks, there are costs to enter the park and for its daily conservation.
It’s also possible to profitably buy a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place that many tourists consider as the center of attention.
The row of buildings that constituted the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a luxurious graph highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For years, the best views of Hong Kong were from the island, but now they've moved to the shores in search of Kowloon’s wonders.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is rather concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists used to come, and therefore if you are looking for proof of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests now are mostly mangroves, but they have roots in those last parts that remain of the great jungles that once occupied the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans occupies an area of 3850 km², of which about a third is occupied by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although the majority of those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
As buses on this route are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
The vast majority of districts are served by small Japanese minibuses which are comfortable and robust.
Taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) or Punakha (No. 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a steel bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The dam is at an altitude of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The clear vertical height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The gold bridge should have been visible by all by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs roadblocks were about to end.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that lived in what today is eastern Paraguay, and they lived as rather nomadic hunters and gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Chaco hosted other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called “the grand province of the Indies”, was formed as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay had managed to maintain a large part of its character and its indigenous identity.
Argentina is well known as one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Even tours and minor parties can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) and its value is fixed identically to that of the British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and often in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
On the outlying islands it’s possible that credit cards may not be accepted even if British and US currency might be fine; check with the owners in advance what is a good method of payment.
It’s almost impossible to change Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving them.
If, like Montevideo, it is south of the Equator, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, it commonly reaches temperatures above +30°C.
Winter can seem cold at first glance: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity mix and it feels colder than what the thermometer says.
There isn't a particularly "wet" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall is more or less the same throughout the year.
Even if some animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the bears are in any case wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals!
They do nothing when they seem docile, but they are, indeed, wolves, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't stay at the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so respect their space.
Also keep in mind that the dogs will attack bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing food or cooking with strong-smelling food outdoors and keep the yard clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a notorious naval blockade when seven ships arriving from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain were refused permission to leave the port.
All the ships had been founded, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were dead.
The search for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city, resulted in the killing of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
We have many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbour district) are found on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
And the sparrows that fly above all the roofs, he knows how to nest without danger and he knows how to stay in the shade of the pohutukawa trees on the other side of here.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive and the bays of Waitemata Harbour, including the beautiful stretch from Mission Bay to St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are three beaches often full of families with many shops one next to the other near the coast. You can swim there without getting tired.
The main local beer is "Number One", it’s not a complex beer but it’s good and it refreshes you. The other local beer is called "Manta".
I had several old French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines could travel better.
The water from the tap is perfectly good to drink, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, a cappuccino arrives full of froth (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The cold chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but very good.
They made many turns at the coral barrier, and injuries on the barrier due to these maneuvers are rare.
However, give access to the authority's advice, respect the signals, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The jellyfish box is found near beaches and river estuaries north of 1770 from October to April. Occasionally they can be found outside of these times.
The sharks are there, however they rarely attack humans. The vast majority of sharks are afraid of humans and avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively hunt within the ocean, their primary habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agency it’s also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Often travel agencies offered packages that included breakfast, organization of transport to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or provide further documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of participants at music festivals decide to camp on site, and a large part of the participants consider it a necessary element of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to find a place to camp near the music.
I remember that even if the main stage music may have finished, there are likely to be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
A special festival has camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's position because crossing the ice makes a terrible noise for more sensitive people.
The cruises of Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
In general, casinos strive to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Usually there are no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to spend.
In a local bar, drinks are offered by the house. However, alcohol compromises judgement, and all gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Whoever is about to travel at altitude or on mountain paths should consider the possibility of fog, ice, or cold temperatures.
On streets with ice and snow, the grip is low and you can’t drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, at any time a lot of snow could fall and cause you to get stuck.
The visibility can be limited by the snow that falls or is blown around, or by condensation and frost on the vehicle’s windows.
On the other hand, conditions of fog and snow normally occur in several towns, and traffic continues throughout the year with very few interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in its popular use, refers to overland journeys to see the marvelous African wild animals, particularly in the savanna.
Which animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and a standard equipment will allow a good view.
I saw the lynx, cheetah, and leopard, all quite timid, and I will see them better with binoculars.
A safari on foot (also called a “hunt walk”, “safari trekking”, or going “for a walk”) consists of excursions lasting a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, just as it hosted the Games in 1964.
If you had already booked the flights and the hotel for 2020 before the pandemic was announced and the postponement, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies change, but from the end of March, the large part of cancellation policies due to Covid no longer applied to events up to 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is thought that the majority of event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they aren't in the room.
If the iron isn't available, or if you don't feel like putting on ironed socks, then you can try with the hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to over-iron the fabric (because it might shrink, or in extreme cases even burn).
There are different ways to purify water, each more effective against specific threats.
In some places the water boils in a minute, other places need several minutes.
The filters also change with power, and if you happen to want to avoid worry, then you should think about buying sealed bottled water from a trusted brand.
Travelers may encounter parasites they are unfamiliar with from their region of origin.
Parasites can ruin food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force, are usually not defined as parasites.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods without taxes and excise duties in specific places.
Those who travel directly to the countryside with a heavy tax can save a significant amount of money, particularly on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont has more difficult driving conditions than the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, with frequent passage through isolated and hard-to-manage terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, use your good sense: they are full of steep climbs, narrow stretches, and tight bends.
The speed limits are often lower than the sections that come before and after – commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it’s more important to strictly observe them here than elsewhere.
However, it's curious how the cellular service is stronger here than in many other sections of the road, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The sweet German ones are rather simple, and in Bavaria they are more substantial and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples and pears inside the pastry all year round, and cherries and plums which appear in summer.
So many products from German bakeries have started to be sent, especially and also beyond fruit with the filling. Popular cakes often go well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a small but substantial pastry, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India or Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other regions on the coast of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term that consists of a great variety of regional cuisines throughout the nation.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to eating with origins from the center and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine has a variety of dishes seasoned simply; the dominant flavors that appeal to Javanese people are shallots, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are there to support the feet of the rider who move down from all parts of the saddle.
The stirrups provide great stability for the rider, but they can be a safety concern due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck inside.
If a rider falls from the horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged along by the horse if it bolts. To decrease this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, the great majority of horsemen wear boots with a nail and a thin, tight sole.
Afterwards, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars which allow the stirrups to come off if pulled backwards by a rider who is being thrown off.
The Val de Cochamò - the main destination for rock climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts a variety of large granite and rock walls.
I always dream of missing the smell of pizza. Climbers from all over the world constantly need new routes among its walls of endless potential.
Alpine sports on the snow, like skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy, uneven terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, known sometimes as “ski bums”, who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of shadows is very old – rock paintings showing shadows date back to 5000 BC!
The history of skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It’s linked to ski touring in an alpine style or to climbing, but usually it doesn’t need to be done, and these last two years on steep terrain with the need for skis and more durable boots.
Think of the ski run as if it were a similar hiking trail.
In good condition, you will manage to cover longer distances than walking – but even rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a significant effort on prepared trails.
Europe is a continent that is quite small but contains many independent countries. In a normal situation, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for visas and undergoing passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen Area functions as if it were a single country.
Until when you remain in this area, in general you can cross the borders without going through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn’t a universal definition for what industrial objects are considered antiques. That fiscal agency defines as antiques those objects which are over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
The raising of reindeer is an important means of livelihood for the Sami, and the culture surrounding commerce is also important for many other professions.
Always according to tradition, however, not all the Sami engaged in reindeer herding on a large scale, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and they kept reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the area of the Sami.
Even though widely used, particularly among my people, the word “Zingaro” (Gypsy) is often considered offensive due to its association with stereotypes and incorrect perceptions about Roma people.
If the country you visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments different from your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East could find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
I had received just a short description of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, or too simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the ability to cause damage, significant social difficulties, or human death.
Severe weather can happen anywhere in the world, and there are various types depending on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, storms, too much rain and fires are forms and consequences of the bad weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
Meteorological phenomena of great bad weather at a regional and seasonal level include snow, snowstorms, hailstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly advised to travelers to be aware of all the risks of bad weather that affect their area because they could impact their travel plans.
All those who plan a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should obtain professional training.
It’s probable that searching on the Internet for “courses on the hostile environment” will provide the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will deal with all the issues that have been discussed here in a more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
A course generally lasts 2-5 days and includes simulations, a lot of first aid, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and journals that deal with escaping into the wild nature are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Those traveling with programs to operate on gender reassignment abroad must be sure to bring valid documents to return home.
The requirement to submit a passport with unspecified gender (X) or updated documentation to correspond to a desired name and gender can vary.
Even the will to govern is largely variable in respecting these documents.
Security checks have also become considerably more invasive in the era following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who need to undergo surgery should not have to face special procedures to pass controls without their privacy and dignity being violated.
The currents of the tide are the water that returns inland from the waves breaking far from the beach, often over rocks or similar formations.
Due to the underwater topography, the returning flow is concentrated in the deeper sections, and there a rapid current towards the deep waters can form.
The majority of deaths are caused by the exhaustion in the attempt to swim upstream against the current, which may be impossible.
Once the current is off, returning back isn’t any more difficult than usual.
Try to go where you can still be caught, or, depending on your skill or if you've been seen, you might want to call for help.
The shock of returning home feels stronger before you have time to adapt to a new culture (the honeymoon phase is shorter). You feel worse and it takes longer to get over it.
Travelers who don’t have trouble adapting to a new culture often struggle to return to their own.
If you return home after having spent time abroad, you will have become accustomed to that new culture and will have lost some habits from the culture of your country.
When you go to a place for the first time, people might be calm and willing to put up with you. It seems that travelers need to adapt when they arrive in a new country.
It could be that people don't know that travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The show of sounds and lights of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
You always hear the noise of tourists and vendors here. The story of the dream and the light is truly like a book of fables.
The Sphinx makes a noise and tells a long story.
The scene shows a group of pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of bases, with 16 bases active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Beyond the islands of Livingston and Deception, where the caldera lake of an still-active volcano offers a beautiful natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains chain, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northernmost part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a peak of 4892 of Mount Vinson.
In such a remote place, without a mobile phone signal, a satellite phone could be your only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a cell phone, because you need to have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used for expeditions, including sports boats, and missions that need voice and remote data.
The local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who plan a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It’s particularly popular among those who leave school, as it allows them to graduate a year early before university, without ruining their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a one-year course abroad can significantly increase your chances of continuing to higher education when you return to your country.
Usually, there is a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a beautiful destination if you like to go boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has more than a thousand islands in those lakes and in the archipelagos of the coast.
In the archipelago and in the lakes, there isn't necessarily a need to see a yacht.
Once upon a time, the archipelago along the coast and the largest lakes were a haven for yachts of all sizes, smaller boats, or even a kayak, giving everyone the chance to experience something different.
There's a boat that is the national pastime in Finland and it's a boat for every seven people.
These bees are in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but here they are quite a unique thing (for example, in the Netherlands there is only one for every forty people).
The great part of cruise ships on the Baltic have a long stay in Saint Petersburg, in Russia.
He told me that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while at night you return to sleep on the ship.
If you disembark only for excursions from the ship, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
The cruise will visit Berlin in Germany during the excursions. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not on the sea and the visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal quirks and the little vices that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
The courier companies are well paid to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
If one wheel is broken, the bigger companies can get their airplane fixed, but for the other wheels and the smaller companies there was a problem.
If they shipped the goods by air, on some route they would have had to spend several days unloading and clearing customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as registered luggage. The regulations of the airline companies don’t allow sending luggage without a passenger, and that’s why you had to go too.
If you want to travel in first class, you have to shell out the money (or it’s even better if your company pays for you).
The price is quite expensive for business class, and usually it's up to four times the price of a normal ticket, or even eleven times the price if you want to buy first class.
It’s pretty useless to look for discounts to buy first or business class tickets if you have to fly from country A to country B without stopping.
The airlines know very well that there are people willing to pay money to travel comfortably and quickly. Therefore, they charge a lot.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a republic with many ethnicities that has suffered conflicts related to ethnicity.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the United Nations.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
In Moldova, the main religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, it is the second port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city of Smyrna, today it is a modern, developed and lively commercial center, located within a large bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, the buildings with visible facades and the modern shopping centers are full of traditional roofs with red tiles, the 18th-century market, ancient mosques and churches—even though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views over the island of Eysturoy and has a rare octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are sculptures of marble doves on only a few tombs.
The valley is worth the trouble of walking slowly through the curious little village.
To the north and suddenly reached is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, which had become famous for its forests after Lord Byron had spoken with enthusiasm about its beauties.
The Scotturb Bus 403 always travels to Sintra, and it stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always to the north, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site that is famous throughout the world for the apparitions of Mary.
I remember that in practice you are visiting a site of fossil remains and also a site that for a large portion of the world’s population has an importance that is almost impossible to measure.
I have still seen many men and women in life who were miraculously saved, and many others who lost dear people who were killed or worked themselves to death, Jews or non-Jews, in the same way.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Ruins my day to see drawings or graffiti on structures.
The official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, the vast majority of road signs are still indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and other services.
The announcements regarding the subway now come in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being eccentric, uneducated, and arrogant.
Even if it’s often just a mistaken belief, the best way to get around in Paris is still to behave properly, like someone who is “well-bred” (well-raised). It will greatly facilitate your movements.
The scurvy look of Parisians will pass quickly if you show them good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has an abundance of forests, mainly beech, fir and spruce, and it has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a great variety of plant communities, thanks to its richness of microclimates, different terrains, and diverse altitude levels.
The area also hosts a very wide variety of animal species and birds.
Here you can find rare animals like the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie, along with many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
The majority of monasteries provide shawls to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men have to put on trousers that reach the knees.
Even this one you can borrow from the store at the entrance, but the clothes aren't washed after every time, so you shouldn't expect to find them too clean with those guys. One size fits all for all men!
The cuisine of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and it uses extra virgin olive oil.
A simple and popular scene, especially in summer, is *Pa amb Oli*: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheeses, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the pronoun Sie for each of the books, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It’s an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It’s probable that it also makes the language easier, even if the writing is rather difficult due to the need to discover whether a verb or an adjective are used in a substantivized form.
In Italian, the pronunciation is quite easy because the vast majority of words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to which one must pay attention are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the vowel immediately following them.
Make sure also to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "dear", while caro means "cart".
Persian has a fairly easy and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a bit about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
There’s no need to say that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a bit of Spanish might conclude hastily that Portuguese is so similar there’s no need to study it deeply.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually old, and remain as museums, or places of instruction.
Back then, the pollution from lights wasn't the kind of problem it is today; often it was in cities or on campuses, quickly reaching levels that those built in modern times barely achieve.
The most modern research telescopes are built in several large numbers in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing cherry blossoms, known as *hanami*, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was born in China where elderflower blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing festivals were hosted at home by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look much better when they are within a natural environment, therefore resist the temptation to pull out even “just one” more specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, picking “specimens” will get you kicked out, no discussion.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place to live, and it’s also very easy to get around, and you can buy almost everything after you arrive.
But if you find yourself in the “tropics often”, just a few degrees north of the Equator, you’ll have to reckon with the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses that go north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of biblical patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
The seven navigable lakes can be a good theme on which to organize the vacation.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or go by boat along the Erie Canal.
It also defines the routes for popular excursions and cycle paths.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions linked to the festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
There's a tradition of going up to a bridge with a view to watch the sunrise with the Easter cake.
It’s clear that there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian rite of spring and fertility.
The most traditional families often host a Paschal vigil on Saturday evening of Holy Week, with congregations that often begin to celebrate when it is midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands, came by swimming, or by flight, or by staying afloat.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were not able to make the journey, therefore the first animal to graze in the Galapagos was the giant tortoise.
Since when man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, they have brought many mammals including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visited the areas of the Arctic or the Antarctic in winter, you would experience the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
They offered a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, if the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you can even enjoy the stars.
Japanese culture regarding work is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The clothing is the normal work attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, and it gives importance to group effort rather than praising individual results.
The employees often have to obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and they have to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
