This not only confirms a well-known hypothesis – that at least some dinosaur species had feathers – but also provides detailed information that fossils cannot reveal, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe this species has chestnut-brown plumage on top and bluish-gray or yellowish-orange plumage underneath.
This discovery also provides a deep insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack well-developed central shafts, known as rachises, but possess other characteristics of feathers – filaments and plumules – researchers believe the rachis may be a later evolutionary development alongside these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests this plumage was not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers believe that, despite being from the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibits fully developed feathers, not down.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows bird-like feathers of an adult and not the plumage of a chicken.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They discovered that the Sun operates under the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is concluded to be driven by self-luminosity, self-rotation around an axis, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotational motion are both used to determine a star's Rossby number, which relates to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is regarding magnetic field reversals.

The work completed is primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for will be created by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Similarly to how the moon exerts gravitational force on Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts force on the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in a way similar to how ordinary matter behaves.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy lies around the galaxy in a halo and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant “poses a very concerning and alarming level of severity due to its very high rate of mortality.”
Dr. Moll believes some patients may have contracted bedbugs at the hospital, and at least two of them are healthcare workers at the hospital.
Within one year, one infected person can transmit the disease to 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of XDR-TB among all tuberculosis cases appears to remain low; only 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa have it.

Four female skiers on the team did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom event did not achieve a ranking.
Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five men who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
The suspects being prosecuted are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite having three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver survived despite suffering severe head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services have freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
After that, Adekoya was convicted at Edinburgh Sheriff Court of killing his son.
She is currently being detained awaiting indictment and trial, but all witness evidence may be compromised due to the widespread publication of her image.
This practice is common in England, but Scotland is different – the law and courts there have found that distributing images can create prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists may well be treading a dangerous path by publicly releasing images, etc., of suspects."
The prosecution office, responsible for all indictments, told reporters that no comment would be made, at least not until prosecution.
The documents, according to the leak, will reference the border conflict, the issue Palestine wants to base on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of the holy city of Jerusalem, important to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands the continued presence of troops in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a presence for five years.
Hunters participating in the supplemental pest control pilot program were closely monitored by forest rangers, as the pilot program itself had been monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Under the cooperation agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association’s recruitment program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial cull were comprehensively trained and briefed on safety protocols.
Martelly was sworn in before the newly formed nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council established by Martelly in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) resign earlier. This recommendation was part of a package of measures aimed at transitioning to a new electoral period for the country.
This order is Martelly’s response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests stem from failed elections, some of which should have been held as early as 2011.
According to reports, approximately 60 portable iPod music players have overheated, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it has been informed of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 overheating incidents to them, which the company claims are "not serious."
In response to the announcement, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "extremely regrettable."
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 AM GMT, Friday).
The Marianas Northern Emergency Management Office reports no reports of losses in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took several tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking the bus carrying them in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many hostages have been rescued, and at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Like Filipino photographers, the six hostages – including children and the elderly – were released early.
Later photographers took the place of the elderly woman when she needed the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He completed specialist training in obstetrics and gynecology and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching prematurity in his spare time.
His research shows that if injected with a certain hormone, the fetal lung growth rate will be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black boxes” from the plane on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also showed their respect for Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the First Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two moons. Unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as frightening as I was... perhaps even more so... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
Thirty-four percent of respondents in the poll share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the poll, 29% of participants believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle swimming events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but according to his complaints, his physical condition is not yet guaranteed.
He couldn't use medication to relieve pain because those drugs were banned during the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper is a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, who discovered the largest prime number ever known on January 25th.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have once been a source of water for Earth, along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, due to comets impacting Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year. Last month, he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called these rumors "political chatter and madness."
There were rumors that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses space-based technology in contrast to ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and providing pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley, with no park and ride facilities available in the area.
Concerns about a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors, without fans of this team.
A study was published in the journal Science on Thursday about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
According to a report by researchers from Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, new species can evolve in just two generations, despite this process being thought to take much longer, due to the combination of Darwin's finches, the Geospiza genus, and migratory Geospiza species.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be crafted into objects of very small size.
It can be drawn into thin fibers for twisting and braiding. It can also be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It can be hammered into extremely thin sheets and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books known as “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of the chemical.
pH is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in a chemical substance.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two pieces of dry dough together, then form them into a ball with wet, clean hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had flush toilets connected to a complex drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths used by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then bounce it back down, almost instantaneously.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images we observe.
A massive rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an astonishing way. The greatest contribution the wheel has made to life is helping us travel and transport goods much more easily and quickly.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
At a lower level are medium-sized species of the cat family, preying on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, many small cat species (including domestic cats) eat small prey in large quantities, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specific job each cat has to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, and they live in groups called prides.
The group consists of one to three related adult males, along with approximately thirty females and their young.
Women often have close relationships with each other in families with many sisters and daughters.
Lion prides operate much like wolf or dog packs, behaving in a surprisingly lion-like way (but unlike other big cats), and are also very dangerous to prey.
Like an all-around athlete, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, long jump, and pull with a force five times that of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same family (Felidae) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cat families are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s growl doesn’t resemble the roar of a lion, but rather a series of rumbling sounds deep in its throat.
Ocelots eat small animals. They will prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that South American forest cats track and locate prey animals by scent, sniffing at every spot where the prey has stood.
They can see very clearly in the dark with night vision and move deftly, unknown to anyone. Wild cats hunt prey by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings, then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small number) becomes separated from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or to a very distant island from where they originated making it difficult to return), this group of organisms will often realize that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different traits or adaptive abilities to become a more formidable competitor than they were before.
The initial population remained completely unchanged; they still needed to adapt as before.
Over time, as the new group of inhabitants began to adapt to their new environment, they started to look increasingly different from other population groups.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, meaning the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable and extremely important consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of our food comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Tyrannosaurus rex was an apex predator during its time, and therefore feared nothing except other Tyrannosaurus rex.
Its long jaw is equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with a second set of teeth in its palate, meaning nothing can escape its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a scavenger.
It also attacked everything in the water; even colossal dinosaurs like T. rex were no match for it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans shared extravagant or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women sat on chairs to eat, the wealthy preferred to host banquets together and recline comfortably to dine.
Ancient Roman meals did not feature foods from the Americas or from Asia in the centuries that followed.
For example, they don't eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Romans have ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each god and considered that place to be the god's home.
People will bring sacrificial offerings to present to the gods, and the monks will strive to satisfy the gods’ needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an outer courtyard area and an inner sanctuary which only priests are permitted to enter.
Sometimes, pyramids—specifically, structures called ziggurats—were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a sacred place dedicated to the god.
With the warm climate of the Middle East, housing isn't overly important.
The Hebrew family has spent most of their time living in open spaces.
Women are cooking in the yard; new shops are opening onto the street. Stone is used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the region of Canaan, so wood was very expensive here.
Greenland has a sparse population. Norse mythology tells that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while sailing west, he discovered Greenland and named the land Greenland.
But no matter what his discoveries were, the Eskimo tribes had already lived there at that time.
Although all are 'Scandinavian' countries, there are still many differences in people, the monarchy, customs, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription “Original Declaration dated July 4, 1776.” This inscription appears at the very bottom of the document, printed upside down.
Although no one is certain about the author of the document, it is known that in its early days, the document – written on this large goatskin (29¾ inches long and 24½ inches wide) – was rolled up for preservation.
So, it's possible the added annotation is simply a label.
The Allied invasion and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unfree.
This area was ruled by the French "Vichy" government. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces launched "Operation Dragoon", invading southern France.
In just two weeks, the U.S. and Free French forces liberated Southern France and then turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a prominent culture shared by a large group of people living and working collectively, a society.
The term "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," meaning pertaining to citizens, related to "civis" – citizen – and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and it also partially defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a cultural imprint that remains and is widely disseminated.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving substantial historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the initial thirteen states established a loose central government – consisting only of the Continental Congress – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress possessed no power to levy taxes, and lacking a national executive or judicial branch, it had to rely on the authority of the states – which were often unwilling to cooperate – to enforce any decisions.
It also has no authority to amend tariff laws or tariff schedules between states.
The articles of confederation required unanimous consent from all states to amend, and the states disregarded the central government to such an extent that state delegates were frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, being the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international arenas and Olympic events.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to its collection of islands/archipelago, Japan is also commonly referred to as an "island nation" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors passed by ship and recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to alter the local people’s grain cultivation practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's (1644-1912) military forces controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been restored to help visitors better visualize their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most popular still photography format in the world is 35mm, the prevalent film size before the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual dimensions of a 35mm format are 36mm wide and 24mm high, which is a bit counterintuitive.
Therefore, the aspect ratio for this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format sets) have an equivalent or nearly equivalent aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often mocked and misused, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while still serving as a way to measure the composition of a photograph.
According to this rule, the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, by now wealthy and powerful, began to come under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has been a unifying force between European nations, despite ongoing differences in language and customs.
Its comprehensive power impacted everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and funds contributed to the church exist for that purpose.
The central governing body of the church has been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth leads many to wonder whether the aforementioned doctrine is actually followed.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Britain immediately imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved effective by cutting off military and civilian supply lines, although this blockade violated widely accepted international law, as codified by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
He deployed naval mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire ocean area, endangering even neutral vessels.
There wasn't much reaction to this tactic. Therefore, Germany also expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing view of most citizens and nations was towards pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the devastation and brutality of war through World War I, nations all desired to avoid a recurrence of that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to America with only four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of introduction from his former manager, Charles Batchelor, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of presenting different historical periods; each stage of Chinese history or each family that held power corresponded to a different dynasty.
Furthermore, between dynasties were periods of instability when commanderies were divided. The most famous period was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce warfare occurred with numerous conflicts among nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying simply to vie for the throne in the grand hall of the Western Capital.
There were many political and social impacts, such as the use of numerical systems, the shift from an autocratic monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to any one ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions became open to all men seeking employment, allowing the most ambitious individuals to succeed.
This also holds true for the military, as military rank is based on merit rather than seniority.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries, urging them to rise up in revolt.
Muhammad was deeply concerned with issues beyond this worldly life. He often went to a cave called “Hira’” on Mount “Noor” (light) to contemplate.
Enduring through time, the Hira cave preserves a vivid image of the spiritual trends left by the Prophet Muhammad.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it’s not easy to find at all, even if people know it exists. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
There was nothing but the high, clear, and stunningly beautiful sky embracing the mountain ranges. A tiny world was known and spoken of from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, features numerous pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), many smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The "rising tone mark" looks like the letter V, and the "falling tone mark" resembles a pin or a square missing its bottom side.
Going up means you should start from the frog and push the frog upwards, and going down means you should start from the slide (where you hold the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
Up-bows generally produce a softer sound, while down-bows create a stronger and more assertive tone.
Feel free to mark up the music, but remember that all the slurs and curves have musical meaning, so please respect them.
On October 6, 1789, while at the Palace of Versailles, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, along with their two young children (Marie Therese, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and his sister – Madam Elizabeth – were forced to return to Paris in fear by a crowd of market women.
On the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a screaming and threatening crowd aimed at the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the carriage window.
Someone in the crowd waved the head of a slain royal guard at the horrified Queen at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost of the United States’ imperialist war of conquest in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of the expenditures and interest on floating bonds under the guise of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become a main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to its formation.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages occurred after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around 1500.
Technological determinism is an overarching concept encompassing many ideas in practice, ranging from promoting or forcing technological development to the narrower meaning of human destiny being controlled by an underlying logical system linked to scientific laws and manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technological development itself follows its own path, unaffected by culture and politics, and that technology has a “determining” influence back on existing societies, rather than being conditioned by them.
For example, one might say that the advent of the automobile inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The sheer number of people owning cars also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, which in turn drives new technological advancements in the medical field to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism had a significant influence on cultural decisions, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals and, over time, the customs and culture related to that area develop – and these, combined with social standing, are preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
It was renowned as a center of opulence, beginning around 400 BC and lasting until approximately 1100 AD.
The city's prominence declined in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders returned goods – silks and spices – that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
At this time, the title of "Fashion Capital" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the attire was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. A significant development resulting from the Crusades was the introduction of buttons.
Subsistence agriculture is a form of farming practiced solely to provide enough food for the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, typically involving only organic fertilization, using saved seeds from local plant varieties combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, a practice that continues in many developing countries.
Group culture brings together individuals with similar ideologies who feel alienated by societal norms and helps them achieve a sense of belonging.
Microcultures can differ based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Factors that define distinct regional cultures can include language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of these elements.
Members of a cultural group often express their relationships through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles such as fashion, speech, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite unfortunate cases of children involving neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, and a lack of social contact from their caregivers as they mature.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (often their parents); in some cases, this abandonment is due to parents rejecting a child with severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Street children may have experienced severe abuse or psychological trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are believed to be raised by animals; others are believed to have to survive on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within their physical limitations) that are almost entirely identical to those of the animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable, the Scaffolding educational approach goes a step further.
Modeling is not a learning method but a means of assistance for those experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Lesson plans can be physical or virtual; in other words, a teacher is a form of lesson plan, but as a small virtual assistant within Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed to ask questions, prompt thinking, and explain processes that may challenge students to problem-solve independently.
Children are placed in Alternative Care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child deserves to grow up in the unsupportive, uncaring, and uneducational environment they are currently experiencing.
We believe the Foster Care System is a safe place for these children.
Our care and nurturing system needs to provide a safe home, dedicated caregivers, a stable educational environment, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home is seen as providing the essentials that their previous home did not.
The internet combines elements of both community and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to many new aspects of how it is used and how satisfaction is approached.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” were proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Self-referencing” and “ongoing relevance” were also considered as new drivers according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated readers’ responses to electronic webpages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting fleeting expressions—those movements that occur on the face for only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is believed that one can detect when someone is lying by accurately interpreting every tiny expression.
In his essay “A President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks points out how people unable to understand the speech due to brain injury can nonetheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that these abilities in interpreting human behavior might also be present in other animal species, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have demonstrated that there are two groups of genetic variation: recessive and dominant.
The additional mutation introduces new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
Separation and recombination occur reciprocally between the two groups with each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy the demand for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant sources of protein are undoubtedly those found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a rich source of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After careful consideration of everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the “protein problem” in a similar way to chimpanzees on the savanna today.
Sleep intervention is the process of intentionally waking a person during their normal sleep time and then going back to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a nearly silent alarm clock to help you wake up without fully waking up.
If you find yourself repeatedly hitting the snooze button, you can place your alarm clock across the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Choices based on chronobiology include drinking plenty of fluids (specifically plain water or tea, which is known to be a diuretic) before bed, which can lead to needing to wake up to urinate.
Inner peace is inversely proportional to the stresses the body and mind endure.
As tension diminishes, positive vitality becomes more present. Everyone has the potential to find complete peace and fulfillment.
Everyone is capable of enlightenment. The only thing holding us back on this path is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded upon with the compassionate path of Mahayana Buddhism and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing the forms of different deities, clean energy fields and chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is generated.
Germany was once a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. Towards the end of World War II, conflicts over systems, processes, and culture caused these countries to become divided again.
In the two years following the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It should have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been truly fought, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans collapsed almost overnight when over 800,000 Red Army troops entered and established fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships and boats to transport goods is currently the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The traditional mission of the navy is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's ability to transport people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy's movement of personnel and cargo.
One of the most notable recent examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to transport supplies and reinforcements across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy also used U-boats to try to halt this supply line.
If the Allied forces had failed, Germany might have conquered England after having subdued the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats are commonly raised in herds, foraging freely on hills or other grazing areas, typically herded by children or adolescents, similar to sheep herding. These traditional livestock herding methods are still practiced today.
Carriage roads were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the cart roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull at faster speeds and with larger loads compared to traveling on the rough, everyday roads.
Tie plates were known quite early to hold the rails in position, however, people gradually realized these rails would work more effectively if they had small metal pieces at the head.
This became commonplace, however iron made the horse-drawn carts break down more quickly.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail line was launched.
The first form of transportation known to humankind is walking, which began two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus apes, did not have an upright gait.
Characteristics of bipedalism are found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more sustainably, we can participate in environmental movements, and we can even become environmental activists to alleviate the burden on the future to some extent.
This is similar to treating the symptoms in many cases. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and how to neutralize it.
It's clear the world has changed dramatically thanks to human achievements in science and technology, and problems have also worsened due to overpopulation coupled with people's excessive lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap just a few buildings away.
Between 150 and 200 impressions were created overnight, now known as the “Dunlap Prints”.
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon in Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A further copy was dispatched to London on August 10th.
25 sheets of Dunlap are believed to be the oldest surviving copies of this document; the original handwritten copies no longer exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today—we call them birds.
Many people don't think this animal is a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
However, birds still share many similarities with dinosaurs.
Their feet have scales and claws. They lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost all computers we use today are based on transforming information encoded in binary form.
Binary numbers can only hold one of two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called a binary sequence – or “bit” – used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious symptoms immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are often insufficient for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest sign of organophosphate poisoning is likely the presence of an open container of poisonous pesticides or household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" in a formal sense to designate this group of insects.
This term originates from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, a highly adaptable insect species capable of parasitizing humans.
Both fleas and bed bugs are late-nesting species, adapted to live in nests or on hosts.
Across the United States, there are currently approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS). This number has made MS one of the most common neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of either themselves or the child.
This couple has decided to plan to adopt a child.
In an adoption agreement, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through scientific methods, which have effectively guided most scientific research.
However, it's not only experimentation and empirical testing that constitute scientific research; posing questions and making observations also guide scientific work.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and particularly the Latin Bible.
Acceptance is Aristotle's perspective on all issues related to science, including psychology.
As understanding of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many rhythms observed in psychology and behavior often heavily depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the generation of these rhythms through biological clocks.
Circadian rhythms, not merely simple responses to external cyclical signals, have been observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue to run free-running cycles even without external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the most compelling pieces of evidence demonstrating that DNA is a type of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to label the DNA strands within bacteriophages with a phosphorus-radioactive compound or bacteriophage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Gene mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected gene segment, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations occurring in the germline cells of bacteria are heritable, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts travelers who enjoy exploring natural areas to immerse themselves in the pristine scenery, flora, and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and researching information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to get to work and pass by others heading to the very places they just left to work.
In a dynamic shuttle transportation system, everyone is connected to and supports a private car transportation system.
Today, science believes this enormous carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear a similar level of complaint about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system generate so many complaints, and why are errors so frequent? Are transportation engineers insufficiently qualified? Or is there a more fundamental reason at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic flow because it’s impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonable limits; therefore, traffic flows tend to be consistently rational and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To more accurately simulate traffic flow, the relationship between three key characteristics was established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. This ability to fly helps them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insect species have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
Thanks to this, they can hide in small places to escape predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are insects that cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people think he was right, but many believe the opposite—that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and all the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest river and the second-longest on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles wide at certain points.
20% of the freshwater that rivers around the world discharge into the ocean originates from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramid complex never surpassed the size and perfect construction techniques of those earlier pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the works of their ancestors that still stood a thousand years later.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the world’s smallest independent state and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is used as a daily language by people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as all of these elements could be found in nature in their native form and were relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that all matter is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is like the four states of matter (in order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he hypothesized that they transform into a new substance to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, from its very beginnings, the pencil has become a good friend to many people.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerged, pencils gradually lost their place and became increasingly less used.
Nowadays, people type messages on computer screens, never having to sharpen pencils again.
One can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
Fission bombs operate on the principle of using energy to combine atomic nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Decompose it once more and then release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they have a tendency to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the far side and about 100 kilometers thick on the nearside of the Moon.
It is thinner under the maria (seas) and thicker in the highlands.
There may be multiple impact craters on the adjacent slope because the crust is thinner there. Magma rises to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on identifying what captures people’s attention or attracts them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired from external sources as they mature.
These theories examine what motivates some people to do what they want and what factors in their environment influence whether or not they do certain things.
Two popular theoretical frameworks are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, there are two approaches that can emerge when a manager begins to lead former peers. The first is to try to maintain close relationships.
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
Someone will become a completely different person and feel they need to change everything the group is doing and do it all themselves.
Ultimately, the leader must take full responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This action can sometimes lead to strained relationships between the leader and other team members.
Remote teams must meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are still minor differences.
Members of virtual teams often function as a point of contact, linking real-world team members who are close to them.
They often exhibit more self-management than regular members because their teams can meet on different schedules, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of the “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a distinctive component of virtual teams.
"The 'invisible group' is the management group to which each member will report. The invisible group sets the standard for each member."
Why would an organization go through a time-consuming process to establish an educational institution? A goal of bringing organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fostered.
Therefore, the process of organizing work together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new improvement process to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership needs to foster a culture of innovation, as well as share knowledge and exploration across the entire team.
Angel (2006) explains that the Continuous method is a technique used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavioral patterns supports scientists in their research process.
For a long time, we have known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some neurological functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has significant meaning in the science fiction industry, AI is also shaping a vitally important branch within computer science, dealing with behaviors, possessing learning capabilities, and sensitively simulating intelligence in machines.
Artificial Intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include controlling, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnostic and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become established principles, focusing on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
AI (artificial intelligence) systems today are commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as in many household computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an important part of the class. Teachers quite often take students to places where taking the bus is not an option.
Technology delivers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing the picnic trip online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future cohorts.
For example, each year students at Bennet College in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol. The website is redesigned every year, however, older versions are kept online as keepsakes.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. When they first start blogging, these students often make grammatical and spelling errors due to carelessness, but the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Students are often the harshest critics, so the blogger started trying to improve the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
Simultaneously, blogging “forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The necessary need to nurture audience interest inspires students to become intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that stimulate collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more adept at analysis and reasoning; through positive responses to online materials, students can identify their role in the context of others' writing as well as articulate their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, boasting a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing both historical and modern Canadian artifacts.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north is Muskoka with its pristine natural beauty and more.
All of this and more is what sets Ontario apart and what outsiders see as the essence of Canada.
Larger areas further north are sparsely populated, and some regions are almost uninhabited wasteland.
A demographic comparison may surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest area and a continent dedicated to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
This area borders Sahei to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Female travelers should say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also have an effect (but only those that don't look too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to situations where what they consider harassment – following, holding arms, etc. – is considered perfectly normal.
Be firm when saying no, and don't hesitate to stand your ground (whether there are cultural differences or not, that doesn't make wrong right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and it was only abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The Kingdom of Morocco rebuilt this city in the style of Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading outposts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina area, you can easily find traditional Moroccan goods for sale such as Tagine pots, ceramics, leather goods, Shisha pipes, and various knick-knacks, but mostly aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was leveled by the Nyiragongo volcano. This volcanic eruption disaster buried much of the city, especially the downtown area.
Although Goma remains within safe limits, all visits from outside the city still need to be carefully considered to understand the ongoing fighting situation in this North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as offering some of the cheapest gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to explore Goma. The typical (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for that short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for faraway, exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation attracts tourists who come to visit, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to desert sand encroachment.
That was one of the key stops on Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has a much stronger Arabic influence than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park covers an area of over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which is home to a unique wildlife system.
This is one of South Africa’s main tourist attractions and is considered the flagship property of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all National Parks in South Africa, conservation activities take place daily and an entrance fee is required to enter the park.
It’s also beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, as it can allow access to either specific parks in South Africa or all of the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is where the territory of Hong Kong gets its name, and it is a primary focus for many tourists.
The procession of buildings causes Hong Kong’s skyline to resemble a shimmering bar graph, clarified by the presence of the waters in Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong from its most beautiful perspective, leave the island and head straight to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
Most of Hong Kong's urban areas were developed concentratedly on reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This is where the British colonizers seized and made their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is a very good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world’s largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The forested area within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
Not only do these areas comprise mangrove swamps, but they also include some remaining sections of the magnificent forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is water/wetland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is currently estimated to have 400 Bengal Royal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) throughout the day, although primarily, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Because inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are very comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a convenient and quick way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge. This bridge spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two 3.5-meter wide lanes.
The under-bridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be officially operational in September 2017, pending the completion of Brazilian customs stations, as planned.
The Guarani are the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, with a lifestyle of semi-nomadic hunting and self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indians," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has striven to maintain its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be held here at other times of the year.
To find information about the tournament and where to buy polo tickets, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at par with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located on Stanley Street opposite FIC West.
Overall, the pound sterling will be accepted anywhere in the islands and, within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British or American currency might be; check with the owner beforehand to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, summer there is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; during the summer months, temperatures are often above +30°C.
Winter can be cold in a deceiving way: temperatures rarely drop to freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all large animals can attack people.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are very large and wild and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, pay attention to smells that may attract bears and other wildlife; therefore, avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and officially became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence conflict orchestrated by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular beaches are located within three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly safe sandy beaches for swimming and most have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on Waitemata Harbour in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get crowded, with many shops along the coastline. It is a safe place to swim.
The local beer is mainly ‘Number One’, which isn’t a blended beer, but it’s mild and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many types of French wine you should have, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be less affected by transport.
Tap water is absolutely safe to drink, but bottled water is also readily available if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a ‘flat white’ coffee is foreign. A ‘short black’ coffee is an ‘espresso’, a cappuccino has a cream layer on top (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate according to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
There are many tours to this coral reef year-round, and injuries caused by this reef are rare.
However, follow the authorities' recommendations, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these months as well.
Sharks do appear, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't typically live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to stay when they arrive.
Travel companies often partner with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel company.
Tour operators often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and sometimes even combine flight and hotel bookings.
They can also hold the place for you if you need time to consider the job offer or process other documents related to your destination (such as a visa).
Nevertheless, any requests or modifications must be handled through the travel agency first and not sent directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the large number of attendees determines on-site camping, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event area, you need to arrive early to secure a campsite near the sound system.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has stopped, some areas of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, double-check your cabin, as the ship breaking ice will create terrifying noises that not everyone can endure.
The travel time of the Saint Petersburg train includes time spent within the city. Passengers on the train are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms and conditions).
Casinos typically try to get customers to spend as much time and money as possible. These places often lack windows and clocks, and the exits are also difficult to find.
They often provide special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers comfortable and encourage them to stay.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages on-site. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers understand the importance of staying sober.
Anyone wanting to drive in mountainous areas or on winding mountain passes needs to consider the possibility of snowfall, ice, or freezing temperatures.
The friction on icy and snow-covered roads is low, making it impossible to drive as you would on normal paved surfaces.
If there's a blizzard, even a short period of snowfall is enough to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice forming on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common occurrences in many countries, and traffic is rarely disrupted year-round.
Safari is perhaps the most attractive destination in Africa and a highlight for many tourists.
The term "safari" is commonly used to refer to overland travel to observe wildlife in Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come near vehicles, and with ordinary tools, we can easily observe them.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs can sometimes be very shy, so to see them more clearly you should use binoculars.
A safari walking trip (also called a “leisurely forest walk”, “exploratory mountain climbing”, or “trekking”) involves hiking and climbing for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at different venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary. However, as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not allow extensions until July 2020 – the originally scheduled time for the Olympics.
It is expected that most event tickets will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Being able to iron wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if you don’t see one in your room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing socks, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (it could cause shrinkage, or in severe cases, it could catch fire).
There are many ways to filter water, some of which are very effective at removing specific hazards.
In some places, boiling water for just one minute is sufficient, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Because the effectiveness of filters varies, if you are concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from reputable companies.
Tourists may encounter harmful animals they have never seen in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, trigger allergies, spread toxins, or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of causing injury or death through force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from value-added tax and consumption tax at certain locations.
Tourists visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The long distance between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through desolate, wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you should brace yourself for steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit in this area is significantly lower than on the sections of road before and after it – typical speeds are around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to these regulations is crucial.
Strangely, and naturally, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of this route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious, and in Bavaria, they are particularly rich and diverse, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are very popular here, with apples used in baking year-round, while cherries and plums are also used during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. They taste even better when enjoyed with a strong cup of coffee.
If you're looking for a small sweet treat from the bakery, try the pastries locals call Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of sauce in it.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries, while in South India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more prevalent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an incredibly diverse combination of regional cuisines across the country.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, this term typically refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Currently found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine encompasses a variety of simply spiced dishes, with beans, chilies, sugar (particularly Javanese palm sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices being the most favored flavors among Javanese people.
Stirrups are devices that help riders dismount from a horse's saddle to their feet.
They offer greater stability for the driver but may raise safety concerns due to the potential for leg entrapment.
If a rider falls from a horse but gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse continues to run. To minimize this risk, several preventative measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with high heels and smooth soles, which are quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the leathers to fall away from the saddle if the rider falls and is pulled backwards.
Cochamó Valley – Chile’s premier rock climbing destination – is called the “Yosemite of South America” with its numerous sheer cliffs and rugged granite slopes.
From the mountaintop, breathtaking scenery is visible. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the countless potential cliffs.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity, with many enthusiasts – sometimes called “ski bums” – planning entire vacations centered around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing dates back a long time—cave paintings depicting skiers have been found from as early as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is a sport that has been practiced since at least the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians living in Australia.
Ski mountaineering: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski walking.
It's related, but generally doesn’t include leisurely or Alpine touring-style skiing; the latter is done on steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trip as similar to a hiking trip.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to walk further – but rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing when you aren’t carrying a heavy pack and are gliding on a flat surface.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Typically, traveling through multiple countries means needing to apply for and have your passport checked multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen Area functions almost as a single country.
As long as you remain within this area, you can usually cross the border without going through additional passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, by possessing a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen member state, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a specific definition to determine whether an item is considered an antique or not. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition has geographical variations, where the time frame limits may be shorter in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though they are much younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is the livelihood of the Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important to many people in other professions.
Although traditionally, not all Sámi people engaged in large-scale reindeer herding, instead making a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and primarily used reindeer for draft power.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sapmi, the Sami region.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Romanian communities, the term “Du Mục” (Gypsy) is often considered offensive as it evokes negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romanian people.
If the country you plan to travel to becomes a restricted travel destination, your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consider advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.

The viewpoints presented are often obscure, vague, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, seriously disrupt social life, or cause death.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and takes many forms depending on geographical features, terrain, and climate.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are types and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and tropical cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Visitors are advised to be prepared for any severe weather risks that may affect their area, as inclement weather can impact any travel plans.

A course typically lasts from 2-5 days and includes case studies, first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are plentiful, but publications about battlefields are very scarce.
People traveling abroad for gender affirmation surgery must ensure they carry the necessary documents for their round trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or to update documents to reflect a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Security checks and searches at checkpoints have become much stricter since the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not assume they will be able to go through scanners without impacting their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents of water flowing back from the shore after waves have broken, typically occurring in areas with submerged sandbars or similar formations.
Due to the underwater terrain structure, backflow concentrates in some deeper areas, and swift currents to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities are due to exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current, which is seemingly impossible.
Right after you escape the whirlpool, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to swim towards somewhere you won’t be caught in the current, or stay put and wait for rescue, depending on your skill level and whether anyone notices you’re in danger.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (with less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be even more severe.
People who easily adapt to a new culture may sometimes find it a little difficult to reintegrate with their native culture.
Upon returning to your homeland after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your native culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people may be patient and understanding, knowing that newcomers to a different country need time to adjust.
One might not anticipate that patience and understanding are also essential for repatriation.
The sound and light show on the pyramid is one of the most exciting things for young children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can gaze at them in silence before the show begins.
You often hear the voices of tourists and street vendors. The interplay of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx statue serves as both the setting and the narrator of a long story.
Scenes were projected onto the pyramid, and different pyramids were illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple nations and host the highest number of bases, with 16 operating in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George, which features the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other areas include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the caldera of an active volcano forms a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a southern part of the Antarctic Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula coalesced into a plateau, which then rose to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest peaks of Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Vinson Peak reaching 4,892 m (16,050 ft).
In remote areas with no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are generally not a replacement for mobile phones, as you have to be outdoors and have a clear, unobstructed view of the satellite to use them.
This service is commonly used by vessels, including tourist ships, as well as expedition teams that require remote data and voice exchange.
Your local phone service provider will likely be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly common among students taking a gap year, allowing them to experience the world outside of education before university without disrupting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a course during a year of leave abroad can genuinely enhance your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Typically, you will need to pay tuition to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boat lovers. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands located within the lakes and along the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a sailboat.
Although the coastal islands and largest lakes are spacious enough for yachts, smaller boats, even kayaks, offer a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with each boat able to hold seven or eight people.
This is suitable for Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but also quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one-fortieth).
Most popular Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city all day for a few days and return to sleep on the train at night.
If you only go ashore by the cruise line’s tender, you do not need a separate visa (in 2009).
Some tours will mention the city of Berlin, Germany in the advertisement. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea and the city tour will not be included in the trip price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages, especially if they have never flown before or have previously experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than a person's fears or dislikes, which many people experience.
For some people, understanding a little about how airplanes work and the issues that can occur during a flight can help them overcome fear stemming from a lack of information or feeling of helplessness.
Delivery companies are paid to transport items quickly. Usually, time is critical for business documents, goods, or parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies often have private planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this is an issue.
If they ship goods by air, on some routes it can take several days to unload the cargo and clear customs.
The only way to get the goods shipped faster is to send them as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow shipping baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
Clearly, that means flying first or business class – shelling out a considerable sum for the privilege (or, even better, having your company foot the bill).
However, the cost is far from cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay four times the price of an economy ticket for a business class ticket, and eleven times as much for first class!
Generally, it's pointless to hunt for discounts on business or first-class tickets for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there’s a certain core group of passengers willing to pay the most for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they price accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.

Modern observatories are often outdated today, and exist as museums or educational sites.
Because during their peak, light pollution wasn't as big of a problem as it is today, they were often placed in cities or administrative areas, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes used for research are enormous instruments, located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
The activity of flower viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originated in China, where plum blossoms are the favored flower.

If visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting “specimens” will also result in refusal, without further discussion.
Overall, Singapore is an extremely safe and easy-to-get-around destination, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive here.
But in places lying within the “super-tropical” zone, just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll need to contend with both the heat (constantly) and the intense sunlight (when the skies are clear, which is often).

There's a tradition of staying up all night on Easter Sunday in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition is explained through Christian theology, however, it could also be a pre-Christian spring ritual and one of fertility.
More traditional churches typically hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday night of Holy Week, and those who gather often celebrate together at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All primitive animal species that appeared on this island arrived by swimming, flying, or drifting with the currents.
Because of its isolation from the mainland, mammals could not reach here, making giant sea turtles the primary herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since humans first arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, such as goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, meaning the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to witness the aurora, as the sky will be darker for much of the day.
