This discovery allows us also a glimpse into the evolution of songs in birds.

Three large bombs were discovered near government buildings within a space of two hours.
Certainly, the toll for the tragic event is already at eight, and official reports confirm that more than 30 have been injured; but the definitive numbers are not yet known.
Cyanuric acid and melamine have been found in animal feed samples, following the deaths of animals after consuming contaminated animal feed.
The two components react with each other and form crystals that can block the excretory function, according to the researchers at the university.
I researched and observed the crystals, which were formed in the cat's eye due to the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid.
The composition of these crystals is similar to those found in the bones of animals, when compared with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
I don't know if it's true that you've adapted, but many goods from Central America come into this country without paying duty.
About eighty percent of our goods have been taxed with duties in the countries of Central America. We dealt with it.
This thing didn't scare me at all; frankly, it wasn't right.
All I tell people is that you treat us as we treated you.
The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has signed a decree banning the sale of violent video games to minors.
The decree stipulates that violent video games sold in the state of California must be marked with a sticker bearing the inscription “18” and selling them to a minor is punishable by a fine of $1000 for each offense.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, gave a statement this morning announcing charges against both Huhne and Pryce.
Hugo has resigned and will be replaced in the government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is thought to be taking the ministry for Business and Trade. Davey is currently without portfolio.
Hughne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on February 16th.
The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21. Cuddeback was the driver.
Oh, Edgar Veguilla, he had to get a cast on his arm and jaw, so much so that Kristoffer Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka’s arm failed so much that it was pointing at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has been through a lot, blind in one eye, with a missing section of his skull and a jaw reconstructed with titanium.
Mr. Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
Regarding the event of Wednesday, in Carpanedo they participated in two individual games at the championships.
The first race was the slalom, where he got a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
Yesterday, or rather the giant slalom, finished in tenth place in the women's starting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed, the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the group of six did not manage to finish their race, and 45 out of 117 skiers total in the giant slalom did not manage to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and the stolen mobile phones.
The Deputy General Inspector D K Arya said: “We arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop.”
I accuse these men: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house, when the car hit it, none of them got hurt.
All the mothers, the driver has a lot of grey hairs on his head.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he had been taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred back to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Ade Adekoya is in court in Edinburgh charged with attempting to murder his son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any testimonial evidence could be compromised, especially since his image has been publicly released everywhere.
This is a common practice on the other side in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system functions differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee observes that “journalists seem to be walking on a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until an indictment.
The document, according to leaked news, refers to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 war in the Middle East.
Among the topics discussed, there is the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA is only accepting this presence for five years.
The tea estates in the additional disinfection test had to be closely monitored by the rangers, so much so that the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a collaboration between the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director in charge of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four speleologists selected for the first caving operation received complete safety instructions and training.
Mr. Martelli has been appointed to a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members.
He's the first CEP of Martelly in four years.
The majority passed a presidential commission and it recommended the dismissal of the previous election authority as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The crackdown was the response of the Martelly government to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October.
And the protests, of violent votes, have been triggered by the poor carrying out of elections, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, which caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said he had been warned of 27 accidents related to the instrument.
After a week passed, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “not serious.”
The minister responded to the delay of the Apple report calling it “clearly reprehensible.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM, local time (9:19 AM according to GMT time on Friday).
The office responsible for emergency management in the northern municipalities has stated that no emergencies have been reported in that state.
Even the Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific said there was no risk of a tsunami.
A Filipino policeman who was no longer in service held Hong Kong tourists hostage after taking control of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
They held hostages in all states and, for once, even lacked the states given to the dead.
Some hostages, among them a son and an elderly man, have been released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot with firearms.
Liggins was born shortly after the death of his father and he began his career as a doctor.
He studied obstetrics and he started working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Since he worked in the hospital, Ligginus started to study the work of premature babies in his free time.
His research showed that, if an hormone was administered, this here accelerated the fetal respiratory maturation of the offspring.
Xinhua reports that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or “black boxes,” on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers went up to offer a gift to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna went away into the night of two moons. Beautiful and unique, just like her. A strong woman.”
Oh, Dustin “Goldust” Runnels, he commented that “the Moon was strange like me… perhaps never again… love her well and lose her… hopefully she’s in a better place.”
Around 1,400 people were interviewed before the 2010 federal election, and those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 800 percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard affirmed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
Over 34% of those surveyed share this opinion, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of those interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, so much so that 31% think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his own problems, his form was in doubt.
Oh no, they didn't let me take the medicine that I needed to overcome my illness, especially since it had been prohibited by the doctors.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Very recently, someone has verified the discovery with various hardware and software since the beginning of February, and it was announced at noon.
And comets perhaps were a source of water. It arrived on Earth together with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, from when and how comets impacted into the ancient Earth.
Mr. Cuomo, 53 years old, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and last month he signed a law legalizing marriage between same-sex couples.
He defined the voices as “of chatter and of political schemes.”
It is hypothesized that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA supports, allowing aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
Oh, thanks to satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology based on land-based radar, air traffic controllers can locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No transport has been put in place and the overground trains aren't stopping at Wembley, and the car park and park-and-ride are unavailable on the ground.
The recent increase in transportation costs has raised the possibility of being forced to play matches behind closed doors, without team supporters.
A study, published in the journal Science, reported on the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in only two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take much, much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch native to the area, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
The egg can be worked in all sorts of shapes. It can be reduced to very small forms.
It can be used thinly, which can become twisted and tangled. It can be hammered or squeezed between leaves.
It could be gold, very very thin and glued onto another metal. It could be made of such thin gold that sometimes it was used to decorate and illustrate books painted by hand, those called “illuminated manuscripts”.
We are here to talk about the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The sauce for cooking changes colour, depending on whether the chemical product is acidic or basic.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (also, hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mixed flour, two handfuls dry and then, with clean and wet hands, knead them into a ball.
The humidity in these old walls reacts with the external plasters, which feel strange and form a layer of bark-like material.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in nearly all houses, connected to a sophisticated system of pipes.
Remains of woven fabrics have been found in the city homes of Minoan Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were public baths in ancient Egypt too, in Persia and in China. In Roman civilization, toilets often formed part of public baths where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you see someone chasing after someone else who is very far away, you know they need a satellite.
Oh, satellite in space, receive the call and immediately reflect it back, quickly at the instant.
Either the satellite or it was sent into space by a rocket. The scientists sent telescopes into space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts partly our light and our vision.
It takes more energy to launch a satellite or a telescope into space than to lift 100 weights.
The rain has changed the world in a way you wouldn't believe. The most important thing that the rain has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transportation.
They brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Under the hills there are medium-sized predators that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
At the end of the day, there are many small felines (including domestic cats) that eat a lot of small prey like insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of nicchia, a special behaviour that every feline adopts, which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups, called prides.
And the flocks are made up of one to three large male goats, together with thirty females and the kids.
Generally, men and women are closely related to each other, and form a large family of sons and daughters.
And prides of lions act very well, just like prides of wolves or dogs, beasts surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and very, very dead for their prey as well.
From a young age, he was a strong athlete, a tiger on foot he runs (but doesn’t really know how), he jumps, he leaps over great distances and climbs with five turns with the strength of a human being.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
Either it's a tiger's roar or it isn't like a roar with a single lion's voice, but more like a phrase of ruffled and dishevelled hens.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, rabbits, rodents and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them by a long shot.
The scientists know that ocelots go hunting and find animals to eat (prey) by means of smell, lingering on the ground where they have been.
They walked very well into the school with the night fog, and mixed very, very furtively upwards. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then jump on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (as if it were separated by a chain of mountains or a river, or if it settled on a new island, in a way that prevents returning to breed), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they came from.
I’m facing a new environment which has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it gradually begins to resemble the other population less and less.
In the end, after thousands or even fewer years, the two populations will be so different that they could no longer be called the same species.
We were talking about this process here, speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very, very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and release carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that comes out of fire).
And plants create their food with their own means through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We build our houses with reeds and we make clothes with reeds. So much food that we ate was from reeds. Without reeds, the animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the greatest predator of its time, consequently it had no enemies, except for other mosasaurs.
And its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 teeth, sharp as razors, with one more placed inside its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We weren’t always successful, but he also may have had a sharp tongue. His diet included snails, large fish, other rodents and he may even have been a cannibal.
He would go up there and defeat everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't have beaten him.
So much so that most of their food seemed familiar to them, the Romans had their share of eating strange or peculiar festive dishes, like wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called *gî*.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food seated on chairs, the rich had couches made of straw where they reclined on one side, thus consuming their meals.
The meals of ancient Romans did not include tomatoes, which arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a tangerine.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a principal temple, which was considered the house of the god.
And people used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strove to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
All the temples had an open outer courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
These votive structures were built, like a part of temples, as special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats.
On the top of the tower there was a special shrine for God.
When the climate worsened in the Middle East, home was no longer very important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was kept to the old ways.
And women were fanning themselves to cool off inside the courtyards; and the shops only had their doors open onto the street. Before, it was necessary to deviate to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas say that Erik the Red had been exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that moment.
It’s known that all these countries, called “Scandinavian”, had quite significant differences between people, kings, customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film “National Treasure”, you might think that a treasure map could have been written on the back of the “Declaration of Independence”.
Honestly, it’s not true. Although there’s something written on the back of the document, it’s not a treasure map.
In the heading of the “Declaration of Independence” there were the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776”. The text is visible in the lower part of the document, in reverse.
They say that no one knows for sure who wrote it, but that at the beginning of his life, this great document on parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was prepared to be preserved.
Therefore, it’s likely that the notation was added only as a label.
The landing in Normandy and the battles that followed had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
It was governed by the French of “Vichy”. These were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In the glow of two suns, the Americans and perhaps the Free French had liberated Southern France and were preparing to advance towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture separated from a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively; it is a society.
The word “civilty” comes from the Latin “civilis”, which means “civil”, which signifies “citizen”, and “civitas”, which means “city” or “city-state”, and which in some way also defines the dimension of society.
City-states were precursors to nations. A culture of a civil type is able to lead to the transmission of knowledge through diverse generations, a persistent cultural imprint and an equitable diffusion.
And minor cultures often vanish without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as old and proper civilizations.
Into the war, revolutionary, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government – with the Congress as its only component – according to the Statute of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, as there was no executive or judiciary, it appealed to the central authorities, who often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Statute required unanimous consent from all states before it could be modified, and the states didn't take the central government lightly, to the point that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and was champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most practiced in the regions of the north, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), which makes Japan the sixth largest island country in the world!
Because of its shape/group of islands like Japan, Japan is often indicated, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing through recorded the name of the island as “Ilha Formosa,” or “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices, and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
From 1683 and perhaps from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) they took or controlled the coastal and northern zones of Taiwan, and from 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is developed into three principal structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings related to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues even today.
For example, in the field of photography, the most common format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It still produces images today, but above all, its proportions have been inherited from the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm film format is actually quite confusing: 36mm wide by 24mm high.
So, I say that the proportion of this shape (by dividing by twelve, to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many common cheeses (for example, the APS cheese family) are equal or very close to these proportions.
So much abuse and frequent scratching of the surface is a simple guiding line that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
He claims that the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become weak and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power, which pervaded everything, captivated everyone, from the king to the ordinary person.
One of the first principles of Christianity is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and misery, and that the Church’s financial resources are here precisely for that reason.
The central authority of the state was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder if this principle was just.
Just as hostilities were opened, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proves effective, with crucial military and civilian supplies and reinforcements, even though this blockade violates internationally accepted law and is codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain has laid mines and internal waters to prevent submarines from entering certain areas of the ocean, also causing some damage to neutral ships.
Since there had been a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In those twenty years, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war in the First World War, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cities named after him, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his baker from his hometown) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between one dynasty and another, there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Epoch of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted around 60 years, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In those times, there was talk of a war between two different nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with millions of people dying in battle to establish themselves on the highest seat of the great palace of Xi’an.
There are quite a few social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Today, the revolution opened up opportunities in state positions to all male candidates, thus allowing the ambitious and successful to advance.
Maximum discourse for the military, because instead of basing the army ranks on class, now they are based on importance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people repressed by the working class in other countries to begin their revolutions.
My mother was deeply interested in questions beyond this mundane life. She frequented a cave that became famous under the name of “Hira”, on the mountain of “Noor” (a place for contemplation).
The largest grotto, surviving from ancient times, exhibits a very vivid image of Moma’s spiritual inclinations.
Nestled on the summit of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is an isolated, airy space from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not at all easy to find the exit, even though it’s known to exist. Once inside the cave, it’s total isolation.
You can’t see anything else like this sky, so beautiful from up here, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing.
Built by the hands of Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The plateau of Giza, or the “Necropolis of Giza”, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, very ancient structures and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids and temples were constructed to honor his wife and family members.
The sign “search upwards” looks like a “V” and the sign “search downwards” looks like a hairpin, or a square without a bottom side.
“Sciù” means you have to start from the tip and squeeze the zucchini, and “zu” means you have to start from the little nose (which is where your hand holds the zucchini) and pull the zucchini.
A high-pitched donkey bray typically generates a softer sound, so much so that a low-pitched bray is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your markings with a pencil, but remember that the markings of the quavers are there for a musical reason, and therefore should usually be respected.
Oh King Louis XVI, terrorized, Queen Maria Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Theresa, one year old, and Louis-Charles, four years old) and their mother, Madame Elisabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they return to Paris surrounded by a swarm of people who shout and yell threats against the king and queen.
May the devil take those people who force the king and queen to keep the little boats of the wagon wide open.
At a beautiful moment, one of these scoundrels brandished the head of a royal guard, loved at Versailles, then terrified the queen.
The expenses of the war of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay and shoulder the costs for the most part, and the interest on these obligations fluctuated in the name of the Philippine Government, through the banking institutions of Wall Street, under the colonial regime of the United States.
Naturally, the wealth derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the primary gain of Philippine imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The age in which these events took place is usually indicated by the name of the High Middle Ages, a period of European history encompassing the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages of Mezo were preceded by the Low Middle Ages of Mezo, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Either technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a great number of ideas, from technological urging or technological imperative in a strict sense, which dictates that human destiny is guided by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
And many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology inherently has “effects” on society, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the car engine drives the development of roads by force.
All hands on deck, maintaining a national road is not economically sustainable unless for very few cars, and thus new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The ownership of large machinery also leads to a high incidence of accidents on the roads, which prompts the invention within the health sector of new care techniques, to provide relief to damaged bodies.
Romanticism or resentment, a great element of cultural determinism, took from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time it spread customs and cultures linked to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
While Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame of being an epicenter of luxury began a little after 400 A.D. and lasted a little until around 1100 A.D.
Their condition was ruined in the twelfth century, above all because the Crusaders arrived bringing with them, after gifts, goods such as silks and drugs which were considered more valuable than those the Byzantine merchants displayed.
It was during those times that the title of Capital of Fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style had its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothes were strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow means of communication, Western styles could remain in vogue for about 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era, after the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that utilizes recovered original seeds from the eco-region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
And subcultures reunite individuals who think in the same way, and who feel neglected by social standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
And subcultures can be distinctive depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of the members.
And the qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, manners, and language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take as an example the few documented cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their developmental phase.
These children are called “beastly” or “wild.” Certain wild children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, abandoning a child was due to the parents’ refusal to accept a serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Those who cry all the time likely suffered serious abuse or childhood trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others think they were carried up by beasts; they say someone saw it alive alone in nature.
When it is completely raised by non-human animals, the offspring will show behaviors (within physical limits) almost similar to those of a particular beast which it takes as a model, like its lack of concern or indifference towards humans.
So that entrepreneurship is based on projects or should make starting up easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding isn’t an entrepreneurial method, but rather a support that provides a boost to people who are open to facing a new entrepreneurial experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding plays both virtual and real roles; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it’s also the paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized into software and has the purpose of discussing, suggesting, and explaining procedures that might be difficult for a student to manage alone.
The children are often removed and placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No fig tree or dove ever grows in an environment that isn’t stimulating and educational, but it happens.
We would consider that the foster care system should be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide home support, qualified educators, stable education and reliable healthcare assistance.
I entrusted him/her with providing everything that was missing in the house from which they had previously been taken.
The internet, or the web, is a combination of many elements, both of content and interpersonal communication.
And distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and approach to gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are proposed as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, fleeting facial movements that last only a few seconds.
In particular, he maintains that it’s possible to detect if a person is about to lie, by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article “The President’s Speech”, indicated how people who are unable to understand a speech due to brain damage are nevertheless capable of evaluating it with complete sincerity.
It suggests finely that these abilities in interpreting or human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection acts on the visible range of variation.
Segregation and recombination create variation forward and backward between the two parents at every generation.
For an ape, with a digestive system like that of humans, it’s difficult to satisfy their need for amino acids with the available plant resources.
Due to this, the inability to speak has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
And the plant-based resources most easily accessible would have been the proteins found in the leaves of legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, larvae) are not digestible with the tongue, but provide a high quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a little like chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of dreaming is the process by which one adjusts to being woken during a normal period of sleep, and falls back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This little is done by language diverting a rather quiet awakening to bring it back to consciousness without causing aerial disturbances.
If you find yourself needing to get up or wake up so much while you're sleeping, it could be because someone is on the other side of the room, forced to stay out of bed to muffle the sound.
This advice suggests limiting the intake of many liquids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces you to get up to urinate during the night.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
With more tension, it’s low; with more life force present, it’s positive. Every person has the potential to find peace and absolute satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended by the Mahayana school of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is brought forth through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the rift between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
She was over 40 years old when she left, and she fought bravely for years, with various armies and for various reasons, on the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Despite everything, these hundred [days/years - context needed for precise translation] were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Although ships are used to transport goods, it is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of a navy is to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move its people and its goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
A recent example of this most worthy of attention was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, diverting mainly the U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
People who crave seats have been domesticated for the first time about ten thousand years ago roughly in the mountains of Zagros in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
These were domestic cattle that were usually kept in herds and wandered the hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were often sons more or less grown, similar to the shepherd we knew. These pastoral methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England in the 16th century.
It’s known that these carriages were simply constructed from parallel wooden planks, allowing the horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and haul heavier loads, compared to the somewhat rougher roads of those times.
And they quickly introduced their state of the art, suitable for maintaining and colliding in position. However, gradually it became clear that tracks would have been more efficient if they had a metal bridge on the other side.
This is becoming a common practice, but I preferred – or used to prefer – using reeds instead of expensive materials.
In the end, the keels and wooden ribs were replaced with iron. From 1767 the first all-iron ships were introduced.
The first means of transport I knew was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, usually didn't walk upright.
Evidence of bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start to live in a more environmentally respectful way, we can join the environmentalist movement and we can even become activists, to reduce future suffering to a certain extent.
Here, many times, it’s truly like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It’s clear to everyone that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that the problems have become numerous due to overpopulation and the bizarre lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress, on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a few nearby establishments to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
It is believed that only between 150 and 200 of these were made, and today they are known as the "Dunlap boards".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he used to read to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
And 25 “Dunlap boards” which still today are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten copy has not survived.
Several paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs, or their descendants, survived and are still alive today. They call them birds.
Many people don't consider dinosaurs because they are ugly and can roar.
But there are several things in birds that still remind us of dinosaurs.
With feet of stone and claws, they lay down olive oil and walk on two legs of right, like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated as binary digits – or bits, to use the computer science term.
Internal poisoning, or porrieiva, isn't immediately evident. The symptoms, like vomiting, are often so general as to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication of internal poisoning is often the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household products.
Check the first aid instructions specific for that particular venom.
The term "scimixa" has been formally adopted by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term or it comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are creatures strongly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both the Scimixes-who-dry-themselves and the Scimixes-of-beds are beasts that make nests, and that are good at living in nests or in the homes of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has discovered that women have twice the probability of having multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple recently decided that it’s not in their best interest, or in the interest of their son, to raise a child.
They are looking for a good lawyer to handle the adoption of their son.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
It’s not just experimentation, though, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more hypotheses, pose questions and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's opinions have been accepted on all scientific questions, including psychology.
With the fading of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its own Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Very often, rhythms observed in physiology and behavior depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological relays.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacilli, fungi, and plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-oscillating systems that continue a cyclic period of free running, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first major pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase proved that viruses inject their DNA into a bacterium.
They used to do experiments marking or DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with a radioactive sulfur.
And mutations can also have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the genetic material of the affected area, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations in other parts can cause cellular death or cancer.
Tourism is based on enjoying nature, attracting people interested in visiting and exploring natural areas in order to appreciate the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, or birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is visited, photographed and knows the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their homes and small towns to get to their workplace, and are overtaken by others, whose work destination is the place they just left.
Within this dynamic transport web, everyone is in some way connected and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
The science shows that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
These problems develop if they feel guilty about levels of mahogany pages regarding the quality of the water or about the quiet of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate these messes, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental about to happen?
Traffic flow is the study of movement between two points of individual conductors and vehicles, and of the interactions created between them.
Unfortunately, studying or predicting traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to exhibit reasonably consistent behaviors; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be broadly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and management of roads.
Insects were the first animals to develop wings. Their ability to fly helped them to escape predators more easily and to find food and mates in a more efficient way.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fly and along the body. This here gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
This allows them to have a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fly and have wings are mayflies and ephemerids.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Certainly some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the sun system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and also the other stars).
This doesn’t make sense, because in Genoa you don’t realize how much effort it takes to get things done, don’t you think?
The River Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Rio de Amassoni is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A good 20 percent of the water comes poured from the planet's streams into the oceans or comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River, principally, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
They say that the construction of pyramids in stone was begun well before the end of the Ancient Kingdom, and the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in dimension and in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancients of the New Kingdom boasted of monuments of their predecessors, which then had well over a thousand years [of age].
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the State, so much so that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Città del Vaticano are Catholic.
And people knew the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper, because these can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive instruments.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
I was saying that it was more similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are plenty of elements in your periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver or gold.
You might also need to have alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of small particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the stone/rock has been a good friend to many people, when it left/was removed.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and fewer uses.
And people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to approach a printing press.
One just has to ask what will happen when something new arrives.
A fission bomb works according to the principle that requires energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A little like when you carry a heavy load up a small hill. Dividing the nucleus again, therefore, releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or much prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The coastline is roughly 70km long on the near side and 100km long on the far side.
It’s softer under the sea and harder under the rocks.
The pressure was less on this side, allowing the lava to rise to the surface more easily because the crust was thinner.
And theories of content are focused on the research of what makes people behave in a certain way, or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized little by little and continue to move until adulthood.
These theories are similar to what he saw with certain people who make him desire and things that they do, and what and the things they did or didn't make him do certain things in his environment.
These two popular motivational theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In the workplace, problems inevitably arise when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or of the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty taking unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they should change everything the team has done, and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often translates into rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the highest standards of excellence of conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often require more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet based on truly variable working hours that their local management might not understand.
The presence of a strong “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Either the “invisible team” or it is the leading group to which all members refer. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the long process of establishing a company? An objective to put the concepts of organizational entrepreneurship into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a challenge can lead to a new, innovative process to satisfy customer needs.
To move forward and for an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational entrepreneurship.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a way to help and organize organizations to reach a higher level of performance.
Recent neurobiological findings provide evidence for a theoretical method of studying cognition. Therefore, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is at the forefront of scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions or tumors, influence behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies now allows us to see and study structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
I am here to provide plenty of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research into AI involves the creation of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer requests, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on solutions to real-life problems.
This artificial intelligence system is often used in sectors of the economy, such as medicine, engineering and the military, because it has been incorporated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of schooling. Very often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip isn’t an option.
Technology offers solutions with trips into virtual environments. Students can examine objects from a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art together with their class.
You're virtually sharing a school trip, or it's also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a memory album.
I started this blog to help improve students' writing. So much so that students often begin their experience on the blog with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of a public audience changes things.
As students are often either public or more critical, the blog writer begins to gradually improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Even the blog “forces students to become true experts of the world around them.” The need to fuel public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
This blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages entrepreneurship to go far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can allow students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to materials on the internet, students can define their own positions in the context of others’ writings and outline their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the fascinating bilingual capital of Canada, and it features a series of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north it hosts the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and others still.
All these things and others still highlight Ontario as what foreigners typically consider to be Canadian.
The largest areas to the north are rather sparsely populated and some are wild and almost deserted.
For a surprising comparison for the population: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much more beautiful than two, and a continent in itself when it comes to wild fauna.
Most of the islands are minor, independent nations, or associated with France and known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had great success in Como and Mayotte.
The influence of the flu and European colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route from the Cape of Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: it is recommended to all women who travel to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's useful to bring a ring (just one, and not too expensive).
And women should be aware that cultural differences can result in something that can be considered harassment, and it’s not rare to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Keep your ground and defend your rights, and don't be afraid to maintain your position (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
Either the Moors built it, or it was constructed, this city like Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the old town it’s easy to find places that sell traditional products like herbs, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the westernmost part of the country, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city’s streets, especially those in the centre.
They know that Goma is relatively safe, and visits to the fire of Goma can be useful to understand the state of fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for more affordable tours in Africa for gorilla spotting.
To get around in Goma, you can use boda-bodas (or taxis on motorcycles). The common price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs, perhaps a little more.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” has been used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
Since 1990, it has been added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of advancing desertification.
It was a key stop in the PBS Wonders of the African World special by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic than African atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, and with Zimbabwe to the north, so that the southern border is the Crocodile River.
It covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a diverse wild fauna.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and has been considered the jewel of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily costs for conservation and entry to the park.
It might also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider their main destination.
The row of buildings that compose the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering barcode, clearly visible from the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely populated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and therefore if you are trying to bear witness to the colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 80km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Despite everything, forests are not only mangrove swamps: they include some of the last surviving remnants of lush jungles that once thrived in the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water or marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese-style buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
The taxi boats are a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places, like Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
It has two towers reasoning an arch of 83 meters, it is long 378 meters and it has two lanes wide 3.50m.
The free-standing vertical height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The full operational readiness of the bridge is planned for September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group among those who inhabited what is still eastern Paraguay today, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Chaco also hosted other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guayacurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century, what we called “the giant province of the Indies” – born from the meeting of Spanish conquistadors and the original indigenous groups – arose in what is now Paraguay.
The Spanish began the period of colonization which lasted for two or three centuries.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a good part of its character and its indigenous identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best water polo teams and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
The swallows and the migrations are fewer this year, which can also be seen in other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy polo equipment, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to that of the British Pound.
Oh dear, it seems things have changed at the only bank in Stanley, after the FIC West shop.
British pounds are widely accepted in the islands, and inside Stanley credit cards and American dollars are often accepted too.
In outlying areas and with credit cards, payment is not accepted, although British and American currency might be accepted; verify with the owners in advance to determine what acceptable payment methods are.
It's almost impossible to change the value of the Falkland Islands to that of fire islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it’s summer there when it’s winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with temperatures reaching around 30 degrees Celsius in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively mild: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren’t any particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of water remains more or less the same throughout the year.
It’s known that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals remain wild animals and shouldn’t be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how many can go by peacefully: bison, bears, deer, wolves and almost all large animals can attack.
Every ten years, visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
For safety, keeping in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted by smells, therefore avoid transporting or preparing foods that give off odors and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the stage for a notorious situation of naval blockade in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships have been sunk, except for a British cruiser. About 200 American and German victims have been lost.
The struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city, led to the summoning of supreme chief Tupua Tamanese Lealofi III.
There are many ways to get around, due to the fact that Auckland is divided between two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
They are all covered in last year’s leaves with snow following, and many have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at Waitemata Harbour, within the inner suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers to Central Auckland.
These are the streets that are narrow for families of votes, full of people with a beautiful row of shops lined up on the square. Now or never.
Initially, the local beer is “Number One”, it’s not a complex beer, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
They have many French wines to have, but New Zealand and Australian wines could travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but bottled water is easy to find if you have money.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee was foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, cappuccino comes loaded with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The chocolate falls into this bread with Belgian standards. The fruit jams are watery but delicious.
Many boat trips to the coral reef are carried out throughout the year, and accidents due to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.

And jellyfish were found alive in the rocks and alive in the foam of waves from October to April to the north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but it’s difficult for them to attack humans. Most sharks are wary of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking a trip in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may still be able to find the possibility of booking other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, organization of transport from/to the airport, or also combined airfare/hotel packages.
You can also keep your reservation open while you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any changes or requests must be examined beforehand, through the travel agent, and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the vast majority of participants at music festivals decided to camp on the spot, and most people consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to go near the action, you should arrive early to find a spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music in the main squares might be over, some festival selections could still be playing until late at night.
Certain festivals in dedicated camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the gullies, because crossing the ice provokes a whistling, horrible noise for those who are closest to it.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the terms).

As usual, there are special offers on food, drinks and housing, to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them on the premises.
Certain establishments offer alcoholic beverages inside the home. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
When hiking or travelling at a certain latitude or on mountain paths, one should consider the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, the friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on new asphalt.
It wasn’t even necessary to hope for snow, it was enough to have a little bit of rain to have so much snow in very little time, enough to block roads.
Visibility can also be limited by haze or by fog or by condensation, or by ice on the small supply boats.
Overall, the conditions of roads and snow are normal in many towns and traffic continues for the most part without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to journeys overland to see the magnificent African fauna, especially in the savannah.
Certainly, beasts, like elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment or allow for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes are timid and you see them better with binoculars.
A safari à pê (also called “walking in the woods”, “exploratory safari” or “walking”) consists of an excursion, lasting a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics were held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Certain events were held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having organized the games of 1964.
If you booked the games and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most cancellation policies based on the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
If you hang the wet clothes up, they'll help them dry. Many hotels have clothes racks available to borrow or rent, even if they aren’t present in the room.
If a clothes horse isn't available, or if you don't have any stockings to wear as makeshift ones, you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Pay attention not to overheat the fabric (as it could cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are effective against specific threats.
Sometimes just zoning the water for a minute is enough, other times it’s necessary to diversify the minutes.
The filters vary in effectiveness and, in case of doubts, you should consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
We have traveled and encountered strange souls who are not familiar with their region of origin.
Parasites can cause itching or eating, irritation or, due to cysts, irritation from allergic reactions, spreading venom or transmitting infections.
And infectious mosquitoes, oh the wretched souls that can harm and gather and force people, or usually are not considered parasites.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers heading directly to countries with a heavy tax burden can often save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Mario and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, with a long passage through isolated terrain in the woods.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, keep your concentration high: steep slopes, narrow alleyways and bumpy surfaces abound.
The speed limits on public roads are far lower than in the past – around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to these is even more important than anything else.
Interestingly, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other parts of the route, for example, the areas served by Pennsylvania.
The South German dialects with Bavarian influence are quite rich and diverse, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with some keeping soft fruit preserves all year round, and cheeses and biscuits that appear in springtime.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other shelled fruits. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either “dry” or “wet”, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and in certain other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands between and around, the food of Indonesia is a generic term that I believe encompasses a vast range of regional cuisines present throughout the nation.
However, if no further qualifications are given, the term tends to signify the original food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Eggs are widely available throughout the archipelago, and the Genoese cuisine presents a wide range of simply seasoned dishes; the predominant aromas that Genoese people favour are pistachios, prawns, saffron (especially Genoese saffron) and various aromatic spices.
And the stirrups are of leather for the feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They should provide greater stability for the horses, but they can cause safety problems due to the possibility that a horse’s feet could get stuck inside.
If a donkey is left with a horse but has a hoof stuck in the stirrup, it could rebel if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, it is possible to adopt a series of safety precautions.
Forward with all that cavalry, wearing riding boots with a smooth, rather narrow heel.
Well, certainly saddles, especially and English saddles, have a bar of following that allows a stirrup to stay in place on a horse that falls.
Cochamó Valley – a leading rock climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of big walls and granite cliffs.
Here we are amidst panoramas of mountains that rise and fall. Climbers from all over the world arrive longing for new routes among their infinite climbing possibilities.
The winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding on a snowy surface with skis or with a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important itinerant activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as “ski bums”, who plan entire vacations in a particular place centered around skiing.
The idea of skiing is quite ancient: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing, as a sport, or rather its origins, date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Carrying a sack on your shoulders with skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
He's connected, but as usual he doesn't involve rock climbing or alpine-style climbing, the latter done on very steep terrain that requires skis and mountaineering boots much more robust.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking trail.
With good conditions, you would be able to descend distances a little longer on skis than on foot, but only with very good snow can you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy load on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean going through visa applications and passport controls repeatedly.
The Schengen Area, for the most part, functions in a certain way like a single country, in this sense.
Since you stay in this area, by air you can cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa, it is not necessary to apply for visas for each of the member countries of Schengen separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition for what qualifies objects as antiques. Certain tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, in which the age limit could be shorter in places like North America, rather than in Europe.
Handmade products can often be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
Traditionally, and indeed, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting and trapping, keeping reindeer primarily as beasts of burden.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the land of the Sami.
It is known that it is used as an insult, especially among non-Roma people, and the term "singao" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can certainly also consult the advice of governments different from your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might find themselves in different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
These anxieties are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The viewpoints presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified in relation to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term to describe dangerous atmospheric phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
The weather affects itself and can be verified in these parts of the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
With strong winds, hail, and excessive rainfall, and fires, are of the form and effects of bad weather, just like the sirocco, tornadoes, floods and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena include snowfall, snowstorms, hailstorms, and rainstorms.
If possible, travelers should be aware of the risk of bad weather that can affect their area, as it could influence the conditions of the journey.
Are you planning or considering a visit to a country that was once considered a war zone or where you could obtain professional training?
A search on the internet for a “Course on Hostile Environments” will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will likely cover all the issues discussed here in a much more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days and involves rolling around, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The availability of governments to issue passports with a non-declared gender (X) or updated documents to correspond to the desired name and gender, varies.
The extent of foreign government involvement in these documents is therefore widely variable.
Even the searches and security checks have become much more invasive in the era following September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before undergoing surgery shouldn’t expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
These are rip currents, or the flow back from the waves that break far from the shore, often on a submerged rock or similar.
Regarding underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections and there a fast current could form towards the deep waters.
Most descents happen due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, something that could be impossible.
As soon as you disconnect from the current, going back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to get to somewhere you won't be caught, or, depending on your skills, if you’re injured, you might as well wait for help to arrive.
The longer the delay in returning it, or discovering it before someone else cultivates it (or doesn’t link it to the charm of discovering something new), the more it lingers and the stronger its effects can be.
And people who have adapted to the new culture of voting have difficulties getting used to returning to their native culture.
When one returns home after having lived abroad, they have become accustomed to the new culture and have lost ties to their original culture.
When you go abroad, especially at first, people are generally patient and understanding, because they know that anyone who goes to live in a foreign country needs to adapt.
And people shouldn't imagine that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The show of care and luxury from the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for young people.
Then you saw the pyramids at school and you saw them in silence before the show began.
For a moment you hear the chatter of tourists and shopkeepers. The story of sound and luxury is exactly like the one you can find in a book.
The Sphinx was found in the background and functions as the narrator of a long story.
And scenes are shown on the stage and various pyramids are illuminated.
And the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are the subject of claims by various nations and have the most bases: as of 2020, there are six active ones.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, where the site of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Among these include the islands of Livingston and Deception, where a collapsed, flooded caldera of an still-active volcano still provides a marvelous natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region to the south of the peninsula, delimited by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here and mountains of the peninsula mingle with the ancient rock, to re-emerge and form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, bisected by the Minnesota glacier.
Apart from the north, Sentinel Range, it has the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In truly remote areas, where cell phone coverage doesn't exist, the only option left to be able to make contact is that of a satellite phone.
Typically, a satellite phone cannot replace a mobile phone, since to make a call you need to be outside, in a position where the satellite can clearly identify you.
I’m used to seeing, or frequently coming from, ships – including those at the port – as well as from dispatches that have requirements for data and voice communication from a distance.
Your local telephone company should be able to provide you with more detailed information regarding connection to this service.
An option that’s becoming increasingly popular for those who want to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It’s common, more and more, among those who have recently finished school, because it allows them to spend a gap year before starting university without compromising their educational path.
Investing a significant amount of time in taking a course abroad during a sabbatical year can increase the chances of entering high-level training programs once you return to your home country.
As usual, to write in these training programs you need to pay an entrance fee.
Finland is an important destination for boats. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has many islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
These islands and lakes don’t really need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are deep enough for all yachts, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This one is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but elsewhere it's unique (for example, in Holland the ratio is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic Sea include a long stop in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
So we stayed visiting the historic city for a couple of whole days and returned to our seats on the ship to sleep.
If you only come to land for a short, organized excursion, you don’t need a visa (as of 2009).
Certainly, cruises are featuring Berlin, in Germany, in their public advertisements. As can be seen in this map here, Berlin is not near the sea and the city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling on an airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s not a difficult thing given the fact of having personal tastes, of aversion for something or another thing that many other people have.
For certain, knowing a bit about how an airplane works and what happens when it crashes could be helpful in winning a bet based on something unknown or over which one has no control.
We run and are well paid to deliver things to be shipped. Many times time is very, very important when dealing with business papers, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For certain trips and larger companies, they had their own planes, but for others and smaller businesses, it was a problem.
If things were sent quickly by air, on some routes they might have lost days passing through the unloading and customs areas.
The only way to get it past customs is to declare it as registered baggage. Airline regulations don't allow shipping baggage without a ticket, and that’s where you come in.
The best way to travel, whether first class or business class, is to spend a good amount of money (or, even better, let those who work pay for it).
But comfort doesn't come cheap: usually the cost of business class is four times greater than that of ordinary class, while first class is eight times as much!
As a matter of principle, there’s no reason to look for discounts on first-class or business-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
And airline companies, oh yes, there was a certain number of travelers who would pay even an eye of the head for the privilege of arriving at a certain place quickly and in maximum comfort, and the prices were precisely based on this fact.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widely used there as well.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
Since 1994, the conflict has led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the European Union.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between these two parties from Moldova.
The majority religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of 3.7 million people approximately, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent strategic point for transport.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern commercial center, developed with more people, positioned around a huge bay and with mountains all around.
The wide avenues, the palaces with glass facades and the modern shopping centers are juxtaposed with the traditional roofs of red tiles, with the market of the eighteenth century and, surprisingly, mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
Oh, the village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, in some tombs there are interesting sculptures of marble combs.
Go down the steps for about half an hour to reach this intriguing village.
To the north, at a short distance, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which foreigners have come to know thanks to the passionate description of its splendid estates made by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly towards Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Always facing north, stands the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place where well-known Marian apparitions occurred throughout the world are said to have been verified.
Remember that essentially you are allowed to visit the site of a mass grave, and also a site that has a meaning almost invaluable to a significant portion of the population of the whole world.
There are still so many men and women alive who lived during that time, and so many others who had houses that have been gathered together or who have died after having worked, whether they were Jewish or not.
I will always treat the topic with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. One must not make jokes about the Holocaust or about the Nazis.
Do not stain or mark the sites with signs or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half the people are more likely to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
To all the municipalities, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the first official language.
Knowing, or Spanish too, it’s widely used on public transport and for other services.
Regular announcements on the metropolitan are only in Catalan, but unexpected service disruptions are announced automatically in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
I avoid people who are selfish, sly and arrogant.
Although it may be a somewhat inaccurate stereotype, the best way to visit Paris without problems is to behave as well as possible, according to the behavior of a “well-bred” (well-educated) person. Thus, life in the city will be much, much easier.
A rough appearance doesn't smell good if you have the love to show some courteous manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded and includes not only beech trees, but also fir and pine, and it features alpine vegetation mixed with Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a wide variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
This area boasts a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
If you can find rare fauna such as the common European bear, the wolf, the eagle, the deer, the lynx, the wildcat and the capercaillie, together with many other more common species.
During the visit to the monastery, it happens that the women have to kneel and rest their backs against the wall.
Most monasteries provide travel blankets for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it has lace on it, you’ll receive a smile from the monk or nun upon entering.
At most, even men are asked if their trousers make their knees ache.
You know, you can go get things from the storage room through the entrance, but these clothes aren’t washed every time someone puts them on, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these faded things. There’s only one size for men!
The cuisine, rather rich, like that of other areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and it must use plenty of olive oil.
A typical, simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is “pa amb oli”: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and a topping that could be things like cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, and also the word “You” which translates as a form of politeness, begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is how to tell the difference between verbs and objects.
Probably it makes reading finer and easier, although writing is a bit complicated due to the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation of Italian is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
And letters that require more attention are “c” and “g”, since their pronunciation changes based on the following vowel.
Pay attention to the different pronunciation of "r" and "rr": “caro” means ‘dog’, “carro” means ‘expensive’.
Either Persian or it has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Reading this part of this grammar book will help you learn the most important parts of Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
If you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
In all likelihood, anyone who knows even a little Spanish could conclude, perhaps a bit too hastily, that Portuguese resembles it so much that there’s no need to study it separately.
Most pre-modern observatories are still too old to be used, and remain as museums or training sites.
Since in the olden days, light pollution wasn't the same problem as today, they usually gathered in cities or campuses, and are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are located in isolated areas with favorable atmospheric conditions for researching enormous structures.
The fox of the six in shō, known as hakama, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where they build ships – and not just any ships, but the most esteemed ones.
In Japan, the first celebrations were held on the streets and organized by the emperor solely for himself and the other members of the aristocracy linked to the imperial court.
Wild plants are much more beautiful when found in a natural environment, therefore resist the temptation to remove even “just one” specimen.
During a visit to a garden organized according to formal criteria, the act of detaching “specimens” for collecting will also be punishable by expulsion from the garden, without discussion.
For a tourist, Singapore is a very safe place and where it’s easy to blend in, and after arriving it’s possible to buy almost everything one needs.
But given that it finds itself in the “vertical tropics”, few degrees north of the equator, you have to fight a lot with the falling (long) as well as with the one that plunges downwards (when the sky is clear, which happens rarely).
It’s coming out of the ancient roads that go north towards Hebron, the place of traditional burial of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the Israeli site, nearby, from Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject for a holiday.
For example, to visit castles in the high valley of the Loire, in the valley of the Rhone, or to take a trip to interesting cities on the Danube or to navigate on the Erie Canal.
Let's define here the paths and trails most frequented by the people.
Easter is one of the most important feasts for Christians, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Very often traditions linked to this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries all over the world.
It’s a tradition to spend Easter night near the sea in some place where the sky is visible, to watch the sunrise.
It’s understood that there are theological explanations for this Christian tradition, but it could well also be a pre-Christian ritual linked to springtime and fertility.
Often and everywhere in a more traditional way, they organize an Easter vigil on Saturday evening at the end of September after Easter, with congregations often beginning to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the souls that arrived here in ancient times did so by shipwreck, snow, or drowning.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not complete the journey, so in the Galapagos Islands the giant tortoise is the main land animal.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, a large number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you lived near the Arctic or Antarctic circles in winter, you could experience the polar night, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
I’m tired, or there’s a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, given that the sky will be clear all day tomorrow.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is often not a problem, I could even enjoy the stars.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than the one Westerners are used to.
We dress in those standard clothes for work, and colleagues call each other by family name or work titles.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, and emphasizing teamwork is more important than praising individual success.
Whoever works many times must obtain permission from their superiors for all the decisions they make and is expected to obey the commands of their superiors without asking questions.
