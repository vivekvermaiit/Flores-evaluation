Ring’s CEO Jamie Siminoff once said that he founded the company after being unable to hear his doorbell from his garage workshop.
He said that he had built a Wi-Fi doorbell.
Siminoff said that sales increased sharply after his appearance on an episode of “Shark Tank” in 2013, even though the show's panel rejected funding for his startup.
At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the shopping channel QVC.
Ring has also settled a legal dispute with competing security firm ADT Corporation.
While an experimental vaccine appears able to reduce Ebola mortality, there are currently no medications that have been definitively proven effective for treating existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise, but formal studies demonstrated that it offered less benefit than hoped in preventing fatalities.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning the scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family advocates for a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and of their sport, are better served by driving meaningful change within our organization rather than pursuing decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could reveal how abuse on the scale so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s survivors could remain undetected for so long, and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes, so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and self-determined environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as a consultant for John F. Kennedy and subsequently for the administration surrounding Lyndon B. Johnson.

The announcement followed a phone call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Turkey would monitor captured ISIS fighters whose return had been rejected by European countries, according to the statement.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and pale or carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but possess other characteristics of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers hypothesized that the sample, although being the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers stated that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not downy feathers from a hatchling.
A car bomb detonated this morning in the police headquarters of the Turkish city of Gaziantep, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
The police said they suspect a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) was behind the attack.
They discovered that the sun functions based on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, luminosity and rotation are considered together.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic field reversals.

He added that “they should not be asked to undertake commitments that exceed their level of development, responsibility, and capabilities.”
The Iraq study group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this time will stop the sectarian warfare, the increasing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report begins with a request for open discourse and consensus-building in the USA regarding a strategy for the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of nearly every aspect of the executive branch's current policy regarding Iraq and urges an immediate change of course.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be launched before the end of this year to secure the Iraqi borders against hostile intervention and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The frustrations within the community led to the current efforts to draft a policy regarding sexual content for the website that hosts millions of openly licensed media.
The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory posits that most dark matter is located in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "extremely concerning and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital staff.
Within one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to remain low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at a given point in time.

The police said the body appeared to have been lying there for about a day.
The first cases of the illness this season were reported at the end of July.
The disease is transmitted by pigs and then spreads to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak of the disease prompted the Indian government to commission rat catchers in heavily affected areas to distribute thousands of mosquito nets and spray pesticides.
The government has also promised several million vials of vaccine against encephalitis, which will help equip the health authorities for the coming year.
Plans for vaccines that were to be delivered this year to the areas historically most affected have been delayed due to a lack of funding and lower prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania went to Sweden, where he began working in the office of the Swedish Post three years later and became their chief engraver.
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.

Infrared images show temperature differences between night and day, suggesting these are likely caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn't as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot paper, with their chosen candidate marked on it, into an envelope.
After the election officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The French election law establishes the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots are present at the beginning of the election and that no ballots are inserted except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.
The ASUS Eee PC, previously launched worldwide based on savings and functionality, became a hot topic at the 2007 Taipei IT Month trade show.

The UN peacekeeping troops who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake are being blamed for the outbreak of the disease that occurred near the troops' camp.
According to the complaint, waste from the UN camp was not properly disposed of, leading to bacteria entering the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest rivers.
Before the arrival of the troops, no problems related to the disease had occurred in Haiti since the 1800s.
The Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy cited independent studies suggesting that the Nepalese UN peacekeeping battalion unwittingly introduced the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, determined that the outbreak was likely caused by the peacekeepers.

She finished her other race, the giant slalom, in 10th place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four disabled skiers did not finish, and 45 of the total 117 female skiers in the giant slalom were unable to place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: “We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and seized her mobile phone and laptop.”
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained significant head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in pre-trial detention until indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that it will not be making any further comments at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestinians demand a return to the borders as they existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The guards of the accompanying trial to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association’s game management program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported. This resulted in a total of six fires and four people suffered minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as “not serious.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Civil Defense said no damage was reported in the territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He completed his training as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm labor in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels made the following comment: “Luna was as crazy as I was… maybe even crazier… I love her and will miss her… hopefully she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed stated that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist should have swum in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as in three medley relays, at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was doubted due to his numerous complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it is prohibited at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially Earth, are formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar, to enable air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There is no parking or park-and-ride available on site.
As concern grew about a lack of transportation options, the likelihood increased that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process would take much longer due to mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a wide variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called miniature paintings, in books known as illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which were visited by men and women in mixed company.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, then use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view somewhat.
It requires a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the wheel has done for us is much simpler and faster transport.
It brought us the railway, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are cats of medium size that prey on medium-sized animals, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are also many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche – a special task that each cat has, ensuring they don’t compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t sound like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence composed of growling, bellowed words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate animals for food (prey). They sniff out where the animals have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually camouflaging themselves with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it originated from (for example, if they migrate over a mountain range or a river, or if they settle on a new island, making it difficult to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks increasingly different from the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then appear so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply refers to the emergence of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants produce their food using the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly nourish ourselves with plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and was perhaps even a cannibal.
He attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex couldn't beat him.
While we likely know most of their diet, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs. The wealthy men, however, preferred to hold communal banquets where they reclined on their sides while consuming their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had, for example, neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's house.
Offerings were made to the gods, and the priests attempted to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses did not hold such great importance.
The greatest part of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of counters open to the street. Stone was used for building the house.
In the Land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were “Scandinavian,” there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the film "National Treasure," you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were the words “Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.” The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
So it is possible that the note was simply added as a marker.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had freed the south of France and turned their attention towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of Congress.
Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also had no authority to invalidate state tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the sixth-largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that make up Japan, it is geographically often referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan’s history begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the indigenous population’s grain cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal regions and, in 1885, declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35mm format confusingly measures 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-criticized and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while also preserving a degree of order in a picture.
She states that the intersection point of the lines dividing an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence controlled everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the important tenets of Christian belief is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was upheld.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally recognized international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire sections of the sea, which posed a danger even for neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras. Each period in Chinese history and each family in power constituted a separate dynasty.
Between the individual dynasties, there were also unstable times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military, for instead of being based on social class, army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Nur” (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has stood the test of time and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, she is not at all easy to find, even if you know she exists. As soon as you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of many large pyramid structures built to venerate deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, encompasses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, as well as the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "spreading" symbol looks like a V, and the "smearing" symbol looks like a parenthesis or a square bracket with the bottom line missing.
Upward bowing means you should start at the tip and push the bow. Downward bowing means you start at the frog (that’s where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Legato typically generates a softer sound, while staccato is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, please remember that the printed bowings are there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
King Louis XIV, panicked, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women to return to Paris on October 6, 1789, in Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the enraged crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified Queen’s eyes.
The costs of the US imperialists’ war in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages, and was in turn followed by the Late Middle Ages, which consistently ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide spectrum of ideas in practice, ranging from technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: on the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology in turn has “impacts” on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One could argue that the private car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures arose in relation to this geography, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so too was Constantinople considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined over the course of the twelfth century, primarily because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of fashion capital of the world also shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, styles in the West lag 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at producing just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic cultivation method that utilizes saved, locally native seeds within the eco-region and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, encompassing fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called “feral” or wild. Some feral children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents’ inability to accept the child’s significant intellectual or physical limitations.
Children raised by animals (wolf children) may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If completely raised by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of their physical capabilities) that are almost entirely consistent with those of its specific foster animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, “scaffolding” goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that assists individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is integrated into the software and is intended to question, suggest, and explain work steps that the student may not be able to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation and blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that isn't caring, loving, and education-focused, but many are.
For us, the system of foster care is a measure of security for these children.
Our foster care system should offer a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home should meet all the needs that she didn't receive in the home she was previously taken from.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the cost-benefit approach.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can recognize whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article, “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge people’s honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations, and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to cover their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking during normal sleep periods and falling back asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you're someone who snoozes their alarm, you can put it on the other side of the room so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another method based on biorhythms is to drink a lot of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect), forcing you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded upon with the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and cultural differences led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last the next 40 years and, in reality, would be fought out by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already completely collapsed, and the only hope lay in a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost instantly obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union broke through into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy has been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans attempted to bring personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic mainly with U-boats.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zagros Mountains in Iran as early as around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Goats were typically kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other pasturelands. These goats were tended by goat herders, much like the more well-known sheep herders; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, trackways were built in England.
Although the track consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed the horses pulling the wagons to reach higher speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails. However, over time, the realization grew that rails carrying a band of iron were more efficient.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some future suffering.
That's often just like treating the symptoms. However, if you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is truly obvious that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that problems have become more severe due to overpopulation and people’s extravagant lifestyles.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the test of time.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many features of birds still resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately detectable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of poisoning from ingestion may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Please see the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "wanze" (bug) is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are highly adaptable at parasitizing humans.
Both predatory stink bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own interest or the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to assume parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works using the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it’s not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to exclude one or more possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and making observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of knowledge of the Greek language, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often rest substantially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behavior determined by cycles, which are not merely reactions to signals from external cycles, is known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that, even in the absence of external signals, execute free-running cycles for a time.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage’s DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the cells in question are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about information regarding the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to get to their workplaces, only to be passed by others whose jobs are in the places they are leaving.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car, in one way or another.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, as driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows exhibit a certain degree of constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of facilities alongside the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of small shelters in which they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in places up to six miles wide.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were already well over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This more closely corresponded to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole consists of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has faded into the background with the emergence of newer writing methods, and has thus been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever needing to go near a pencil sharpener.
It will be interesting to see what becomes of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. If the nucleus is split again, some of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they decay with little to no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the Highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content-based theories focus on identifying what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories concern themselves with what motivates certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment lead them to do—or not do—certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors tend to emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain “one of the guys” (or one of the girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and appropriates everything for themselves.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are managed to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may meet in time zones not considered by local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, collaborative work within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process for addressing customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the scope of research and making it considerably more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries, and tumors, can affect behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science concerned with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI encompasses the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, establishing strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines focused on finding solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important component for every school class. It is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Virtual excursions represent a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but previous versions remain online and serve as a collection of memories.
Blogs can also help to improve students’ writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve their writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging “also compels students to learn more about the world around them.” The need to capture the audience’s interest inspires students to write cleverly and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning well beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others’ texts and articulate their own perspectives on specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is distinguished by a variety of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, pristine natural beauty stretches across Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more define Ontario as what outsiders perceive as typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel zone and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as assault, and that being followed, grabbed by the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Stay consistent when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences aside; that doesn’t mean it’s okay!).
The modern-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it’s all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to ascertain the status of ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made “Timbuktu” a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is a impoverished city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the key stops on Louis Gates’ PBS special “Wonders of the African World.”
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife population.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entry fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main focus for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a glittering bar chart, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and go to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that British colonists appropriated for themselves. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world’s largest mangrove forest and stretch 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a protected area since 1966, and estimates now suggest they are home to around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters, and it has two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The underbridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the road was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to fully open to traffic in September 2017. The Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group to inhabit present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the large province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
Information on competitions and ticket outlets for polo matches can be found at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, however British and US currency may be accepted; inquire with the owners in advance as to which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange your money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authority instructions, visitors should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, elk, moose, bears, and practically all large animals may seem, it is still possible for them to become aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of space.
Also be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and maintain a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for a British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland stretches across two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
There are family beaches, which can sometimes be crowded, with a lovely shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming here is safe.
The most important local beer is “Number One.” It’s not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta.”
There are many French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps easier to drink.
You can drink the local tap water without worry, but if you are concerned, bottled water is also readily available.
For Australians, the idea of a “Flat White” coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is an “Espresso”, cappuccino is filled high with cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place year-round, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in estuarine areas north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the certainty that they have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g., visas).
Any changes or requests, however, should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that music will still be playing in parts of the festival late into the night, even after the music has stopped on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, as the ice breaking causes quite dreadful noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also allow time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and to get them to spend a lot of money. There are typically no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and encourage them to stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players understand how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to travel at high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is reduced and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" commonly refers to a journey overland to observe the magnificent African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or footing) consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, having already been the host city in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies were not enforced until July 2020 due to the coronavirus, as the Olympic Games were scheduled for that time.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500¥ and 130,000¥, with an average ticket price of around 7,000¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (it could shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause it to burn).
There are various methods for water purification. Some of these prove more effective in countering specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation, and, at worst, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals capable of violently injuring or killing humans, are not usually classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and consumption taxes in certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is arguably the greatest driving challenge, as it frequently passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay vigilant: steep descents, narrow roadways, and sharp curves predominate here.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, interestingly enough, the cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria, they are rather rich and varied, as they are in neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being cooked into baked goods year-round, and cherries and plums used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is known as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid used.
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when the term is used without further attributes, it generally refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar), and a range of aromatic spices as flavor carriers.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of riders that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could potentially get caught in them.
If a rider falls from the horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse bolts. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that allow a stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular activities where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and descend a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in one specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was founded by Norwegians.
Backcountry skiing with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski mountaineering.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but doesn't necessarily include them, as the latter is typically done on steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as you would a comparable hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you are able to cover somewhat greater distances than when hiking – you will only very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for visas multiple times and go through several passport controls if you want to travel through multiple countries.
However, in this respect, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not need to apply for a visa individually for each of the Schengen member countries with a Schengen visa, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition exhibits geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products might be labeled “antique” even if they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding it is also significant for many who work in other professions.
In the past, not all Sámi herded reindeer on a large scale, but rather made a living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They kept reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even though the term "Zigeuner" is primarily used by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments besides your own. However, their recommendations are tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, major social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types of it that depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include, among others, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to pay attention to any kind of inclement weather affecting their area, as this may impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
An internet search for "course on hostile environments" will likely display the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is typically between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies greatly.
Security checks have also become far more intrusive in the time following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when going through scanners before their surgery.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves broken on the beach, often occurring near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a fast current extending down to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to get somewhere you won’t be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether or not you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase isn’t as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.
When you return home after a stay abroad, you have adjusted to a different culture and shed some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required towards returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and while it is quiet, before the show begins.
Normally, you constantly hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of the sounds and lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations – sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Further islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here transition into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Mount Vinson, reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions requiring data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning a gap year is studying and taking courses abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year program abroad can actually improve your chances of getting into university in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful travel destination for boat trips. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, with one in six or eight people owning a boat.
While this is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (for example, the ratio in the Netherlands is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for several days, returning in the evenings to spend the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of organized ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have a traumatic experience in their past.
There’s no need to be ashamed of that: it’s nothing more than the personal fears and dislikes that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or with feeling a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for the fast delivery of goods. Often, time is a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies deploy their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies, difficulties arose.
If they shipped items via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as unaccompanied baggage. Airline regulations don't allow baggage to be shipped without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious method of flying in First or Business Class is to shell out a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your company to foot the bill).
That said, it's not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times the normal economy fare for first class!
Generally, it's pointless to even look for discounts on Business or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are very well aware that there is a core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and who expect prices to reflect that.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova could be restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, advanced, and bustling business center located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classical red tile roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth taking a half hour to stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north and in close proximity lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly from Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also visit in the north the great shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) – a place world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a place that has almost immeasurable significance for a large part of the world's population.
Many men and women are still alive who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked themselves to death – Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the site by applying or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only displayed in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other institutions.
Normal announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, impolite, and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an inaccurate cliché, you'll get around Paris best when you present your best self and behave like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will significantly ease your way.
The Parisians' brusque exterior disappears very quickly if you display basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with beech, spruce, and fir trees predominating, and it offers a blend of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably diverse range of plant communities thanks to its numerous microclimates, varied soils, and alternating altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely diverse range of animal and bird species.
There you can find rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats and black grouse, as well as many generally more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach below the knee and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do have wrap-around skirts available for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach below the knee.
These are also available for loan from stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is a one-size-fits-all option for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple, popular evening meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any ingredient currently available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns begin with a capital letter, besides the word "Sie" for "you," even in the middle of a sentence.
That is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier as well, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also pay attention to pronouncing "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means "dear," whereas "carro" means "chariot."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand formulations better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak some Spanish, however, might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn’t need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't the problem during its peak that it is today, they are generally located in cities or on university campuses that are more accessible than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other nobles within the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally designed garden and collect “samples,” you will also be thrown out without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to get around and where you can buy almost anything after arriving.
Since you are located in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you must expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that travel northwards to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or a river cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also feature popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted worldwide by both believers and non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at some open spot to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also quite possibly be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with community celebrations often beginning around midnight, commemorating the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or being washed ashore.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first people entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be used to.
Suits are considered standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being more on team performance than on praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must obtain their supervisors' approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their managers' instructions unconditionally.
