Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola virus, so far no drug has been definitively proven effective in treating existing infections.
An experimental treatment called ZMapp, an “antibody cocktail” (a combination of multiple antibodies), initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated its effectiveness in preventing death was somewhat disappointing.
In the PALM experiment, ZMapp was used as a reference—that is, scientists used it as a baseline against which to compare three other treatments.
The USA Gymnastics Association expressed its support for the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee’s letter and accepted the strict demands of the Olympic family – to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the statement from the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee that pursuing meaningful change within our organization may be more beneficial to safeguarding the interests of athletes and clubs, and their sport, than revoking licenses.
According to an independent investigation supported by USA Gymnastics, we may finally learn why the widespread abuse by Larry Nassar, bravely exposed by survivors, went undetected for so long. Furthermore, the association stated it will make necessary and appropriate reforms.
The USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee share a common goal: to ensure the safety of gymnastics and other sports as much as possible, and to allow athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski first served as an advisor to John F. Kennedy, and later worked for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that is already widely circulated—but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists stated that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown on top and light-colored or carrot-colored underneath.
This discovery also helps to deepen our understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaurs’ feathers didn’t have a well-developed central shaft—known as a rachis—but still possessed other characteristics of feathers, such as barbs and barbules, leading researchers to infer that the evolution of the rachis likely occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers believe the sample shows mature plumage, not downy juvenile feathers, despite being from the tail of a young dinosaur.
Researchers believe that despite being a young dinosaur’s tail, the sample displays adult feathers rather than the down of a hatchling.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

The completed work is mostly theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program is to simulate observations of the Andromeda Galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for could be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in galaxies and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Andromeda Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
The theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy resides in a halo around the galaxy, composed of numerous small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered this extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that this new variant is "very unsettling and worrying, because its mortality rate is very high."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the bacteria while in the hospital, and at least two of the patients are medical staff at the hospital.
Within a year, one infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) within the overall tuberculosis patient population appears to remain low; in South Africa, at any given time, only 6,000 people are infected out of a total of 330,000.

Infrared imagery shows that temperature variations between day and night suggest these locations are likely caves.
Compared to the surrounding surfaces, they are cooler during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which typically maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it’s similar to what we see with deep pits underground,” said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a rather low-tech experience: voters enter a small booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter’s identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
French election law establishes quite strict regulations for the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to see that the box is empty at the start of voting and that no one except eligible voters who have already voted places envelopes inside.
Candidates may send representatives to observe every stage of the election process. In the evening, volunteers counted the ballots under strict supervision according to a specific procedure.

The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider requires facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned while pointed at the fifth person’s head. Schneider was in excruciating pain, blinded in one eye, and missing a piece of his skull; his face was reconstructed using titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) base in his home country, the United States.
In addition to the match on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions within the championship.
Her first event was banked slalom, and she finished the first run with a “did not finish” result. Of the 116 competitors in the event, 36 others achieved the same result.
Her other competition was giant slalom, where she finished tenth in the women's standing group with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian Claudia Rausch who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place Hungarian Dani Konszky.
Four skiers from the women's alpine combined team failed to finish, and out of 117 competitors in the giant slalom event, 45 did not make the cut.
Central state police recovered the stolen laptops and phones.
Deputy Inspector General Arya stated, “We have arrested 5 people who raped this Swiss woman, and we have recovered her phone and laptop.”
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that all the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency responders rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterward, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son and stood trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She has been detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any witness testimony could be negatively impacted because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland’s legal system is different, and the courts believe publishing the photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out, “It does seem there is a potential for harm if journalists publish information such as the photos of suspects.”
The main prosecuting body, the Royal Prosecution Office, stated to reporters that it will not make any further statements, at least until charges are filed.
It is revealed that the document will mention the border dispute, with Palestine hoping for a basis on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Reportedly, other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the valley after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to five years.
Forest rangers will closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplemental pest control trials, as the trials will be monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales Shooting Association (NSW), the Shooting Association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O’flynn, Acting Director of the Conservation and Heritage Management Branch of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in New South Wales, Australia, stated that the four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation had all received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new interim electoral council (CEP) comprised of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth time being selected to Haiti’s Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Council recommended the former CEP resign, as part of a push to move the country towards new electoral measures.
The committee is a response by Martelly to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protests have been triggered by some elections failing to take place as scheduled, and sometimes escalate into violent incidents.
Reports indicate approximately 60 incidents of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in 6 fires and 4 minor burn injuries.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they have noted 27 incidents associated with the device.
Last week, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating, despite the company characterizing them as “not serious.”
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expressed regret over Apple’s decision to postpone the release of its report, calling it "very regrettable."
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reports no damage or losses within the island territory.
Moreover, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no signs of a tsunami have been detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila, taking Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and opened fire on the tourists.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, and at least six hostages have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and the elderly) and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Two photographers then replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching prematurity in his spare time.
His research indicates that administering hormones can accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two flight recorders, or “black boxes,” on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Supreme Queen, my first manager. Luna passed away on a night of the double moon. Such a night is as special as she was. She was a strong woman.”
Dustin Runnels (aka “Goldust”) commented, “Luna is as elusive as I am… she might be even harder to figure out… I love her and will miss her… I hope she’s gone to a better place.”
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted before the 2010 federal election, and the number of respondents opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's abdication.
34% of respondents unanimously expressed the hope that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia’s last monarch.
The vote is polarized, with 29% of respondents believing Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was originally scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been questioned ever since his complaints.
He has been unable to alleviate his pain with medication because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper of the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, and these organic matter can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, especially how Earth itself was formed.
Currently 53 years old, Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He dismissed the rumors as "political babble and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than outdated ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transportation was added, the overground train does not stop at Wembley, and there are no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the match may be forced to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal *Science* reported that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden report that this new species evolved in just two generations due to breeding between the local Darwin's finch, the ground finch, and the introduced cactus finch, despite the belief that such a process would take much longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be drawn into fine threads for winding and braiding, or hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhere to other metals, and due to being so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books known as “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH value represents the quantity of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical being measured.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together until combined, then use clean, wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, creating a shell-like texture that feels quite interesting.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, these two cities had flush toilets in almost every house, and these toilets were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Traces of a sewage system have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that were mixed-gender.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using satellites.
Satellites in space almost immediately reflect back any phone calls they receive.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and visibility.
To send satellites or telescopes into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. Its greatest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines, which prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits and gazelles to deer.
Ultimately, many small feline species (including free-ranging domestic cats) subsist on a far greater number of small prey items such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is a niche concept, with each cat responsible for a specific job, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in large groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters within a large family, females generally have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. These animals exhibit behaviors remarkably similar to lions (but unlike other big cats), and these behaviors are also very deadly to their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes; they can climb (although not very well), swim, and long jump, with a pulling strength five times that of a strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars all belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only feline species that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't as deep as a lion's; it's more like an angry shout.
Leopard cats enjoy eating small animals. If conditions allow, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. A leopard cat’s prey is almost always much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey animals by scent and by sniffing the tracks of their prey on the ground.
They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see clearly in the dark, and are also very stealthy. Leopard cats hunt by first blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from its original main population—for example, by crossing mountains and rivers, or by arriving on a new island making return difficult—they typically find that the environment they are in is different from the one they previously knew.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor, rather than those they required previously.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need to adapt to the environment as they did before.
As time passed, new populations began to adapt to their new environments, and they started to become increasingly dissimilar from other populations.
After enduring thousands, or even millions, of years, these two populations will eventually look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and an extremely important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build houses with plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Plesiosaurs were the apex predators of their time, fearing nothing except their own kind.
Its long lower jaw is covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and another row lines its upper jaw. This means anything that encounters it has nowhere to escape.
Its tongue may be forked, though we are not yet certain. Its diet includes turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it has even been known to eat humans.
It attacks anything that enters the water; even massive dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus Rex are no match for it.
Although much of the Roman diet was similar to what we know today, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that the poor and women sat on chairs to eat, while the rich preferred to gather for banquets and recline while dining.
Foods that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have been part of the ancient Romans’ diet.
For example, they didn’t have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, nor did any ancient Roman ever eat turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, considering it the god’s dwelling place.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an outer courtyard open to the public, as well as an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Some special towers are pyramid-shaped and are called golden pagoda towers, built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special holy place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house isn't very important.
Life in Hebrew families was mostly spent outdoors.
The women are cooking in the courtyard; shops are essentially open counters facing the street. They build houses with stones.
Canaan did not have large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and he sailed west, discovered land, and named it Greenland.
But whether or not he discovered it, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belonging to “Scandinavia,” there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think there’s a treasure map drawn on the back of the *Declaration of Independence*.
However, that is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and is reversed.
Although no one can determine the author, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been stored rolled up when first written.
Therefore, it's very likely that this symbol was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These Frenchmen reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, choosing not to resist the invaders but to cooperate with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces landed in southern France, an operation known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a group of people (society) who live together and work cooperatively.
The term “civilization” originates from the Latin word “civilis” (meaning “of citizens”), and is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning “citizen”) and "civitas" (meaning “city” or “city-state”), which also, in a way, defines the scale of a society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilization-based culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the lingering and preserved traces of culture, and the fair dissemination of culture.
The cultures of minority ethnic groups often disappear without a trace, leaving behind no related historical evidence, and are not considered proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its sole component).
Congress lacks the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress can only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, which state governments often fail to cooperate with.
It also has no power to overturn the tax laws and tariffs between states.
These terms require unanimous consent from all states to be amended, and the states treat the central government with such disdain that their state representatives frequently absent themselves.
Both the Italian and German national football teams are among the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, American football, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan boasts nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the world's seventh-largest island country!
Due to Japan's numerous islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
Western understanding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa," meaning "Beautiful Island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began to alter the food production methods of the indigenous people, and hired Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army controlled western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Great Qing Empire announced the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of Three Windows.
To allow visitors a better understanding of the original appearance of the complex, most of the buildings along the edges of the architectural complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is 35mm format, which was the dominant film size during the late film era.
Even today, production continues, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual dimensions of the 35mm format are 36mm wide and 24mm high, which makes the format a bit confusing, actually.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) share this aspect ratio or are very close to it.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed, can still be a simple guiding method for creating dynamic compositions and maintaining order in images.
It points out that the most effective placement for the subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under close scrutiny.
Despite the diverse languages and customs of European countries, Christianity has linked them together for over a thousand years.
From kings to commoners, its pervasive power influences everyone, everywhere.
One of the core tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund was specifically established for this purpose.
The centralized system of the church existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether they adhered to its tenets.
Shortly after hostile actions broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
They cut off the supply of vital military and civilian goods. This strategy proved effective, despite the blockade violating international law, widely accepted over the past two centuries through numerous international conventions.
Britain laid mines in international waters, preventing any vessels from entering the entire sea area, and even posed a threat to ships of neutral countries.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany hoped for a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was one of pacifism and separatism.
Having witnessed the devastation and brutality of World War I, all nations desired to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job with Edison Company in New York City.
Upon arriving in America, he had with him 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer’s manager) to Thomas Edison.
Different periods in ancient China each had their own characteristics; each period of China or each family that held power was a distinctly characterized dynasty.
Similarly, periods of dynastic change have consistently been times of instability and fragmentation with numerous small states. The most famous of these is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various feudal lords engaged in fierce warfare to争夺 the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most turbulent and bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Countless people died in the struggle for supreme power in the opulent palaces of Xi'an.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of units of measurement, the transition from autocracy to republic, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs not to a single ruler but to its people.
Furthermore, after the revolution, official positions were opened to applications from all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to rise through the ranks.
The army is the same; promotions are no longer based on seniority, but on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes in many other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequently went to a cave called “Hira” on Mount “Nur” (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself not only withstood the test of time and remained preserved, but also provided an extremely vivid image for Muhammad’s spiritual orientation.
The cave is located on a mountaintop north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing it exists doesn’t make it easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely cut off from the outside world.
Besides the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. Inside the cave, one can hardly see or hear anything from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the ancient Egyptians, dating back to the 3rd century BC, and is one of many large pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt's Valley of the Dead (also known as the "Giza Pyramid Complex") includes several pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate the Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The “upper arc” symbol looks like the letter V, while the “lower arc” symbol looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
Upward refers to pushing the bow from the top end, while downward refers to drawing the bow from the base (where you hold the bow).
Up-bows generally produce a softer sound, while down-bows create a stronger, more assertive tone.
Feel free to mark up the music with pencil as you wish, but remember that the printed notes have musical meaning and should generally be treated with respect.
On October 6, 1789, the startled King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), along with the King’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were driven back to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris by carriage, and were surrounded by a crowd who shouted and threatened the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows completely.
Before the terrified Queen, a rioter once brandished the head of a royal guard who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, to cover most expenses, and the interest on bonds issued through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the huge profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become a basic source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the historical context that led to their formation.
The era in which the event occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing many ideas in practice, including technological push, technological necessity, and a strict definition—that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: first, that the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and second, that technology, in turn, has an inherent “impact” on society independent of social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, providing a national road network for only a small number of cars is economically infeasible, therefore new modes of production emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high volume of Volkswagen vehicles can also lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will then drive the invention of new medical technologies for treating injuries sustained in those accidents.
Romanticism exhibits a strong sense of cultural determinism, originating with writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerge – customs and cultures that, due to their harmonious integration with the place a society inhabits, are far superior to any arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of medieval Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury goods center began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its importance declined in the twelfth century, mainly because gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of “fashion capital” shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to 14th centuries.
Initially, dresses were deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advancements at the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing, following the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agricultural activity conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that maximizes yields by utilizing locally preserved seeds within the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture. This remains the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms, fostering a sense of identity among them.
Given the differences in members’ age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender, subcultures may be distinct from one another.
The traits that make subcultures distinct may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultures often symbolically employ distinctive styles of behavior to indicate their group affiliation, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use case studies of unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, did not achieve socialization with the help of adults during their development.
Children like these are called “wild children,” meaning feral children. Some wild children are confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child is due to the parents’ refusal to accept a severe intellectual or physical disability.
Runaway and abandoned children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that others were raised by animals; some people live alone in the wilderness.
If a child were raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits of their physical capabilities) would closely resemble that of the animal, for example, exhibiting fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding learning goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a means to assist those who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
Scaffolding instruction can be delivered online or offline; in other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, just like the Clippy assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized within the software to question, prompt, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are fostered for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment devoid of nurture, care, and education, but unfortunately, that is often the case.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster care system should provide everything lacking in the child’s birth family in terms of necessities.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet add extra dimensions to its uses and how it satisfies needs.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When researching audience responses to websites, Aime and McCredie (1998) identified “personal engagement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivational factors.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in understanding microexpressions (fleeting facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds).
Specifically speaking, it is said that one can judge whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay “The President’s Speech,” pointed out that people who are unable to understand language due to brain injury can still accurately judge whether a speaker is being sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be a capacity shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that gene mutations have two repositories: dominant and recessive.
Mutation introduces new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the expressed gene pool.
Due to separation and recombination, variation fluctuated back and forth between the two libraries with each generation.
On the tropical savanna, primates possess digestive systems similar to humans, and the existing plant resources struggle to meet their amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, failure to do so will have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources are likely leaves and protein from legumes, but primates like us find this protein difficult to digest unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Therefore, it should come as no surprise if our ancestors solved the “protein problem” in the same way that chimpanzees in tropical savannas do today.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep, and falling back asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to achieve, using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without being fully roused.
If you find yourself repeatedly hitting snooze, try placing your alarm clock across the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm based choices include drinking large amounts of fluids before bed (especially water or tea – both known diuretics), and forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person experiences is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The less pressure one feels, the more actively one’s vitality is expressed. Everyone is capable of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of reaching enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses the methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of awakening) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core practice of Tibetan meditation is Tummo (inner heat) yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can attain a state of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which fostered cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, with the end of the war, conflicts in systems, procedures, and culture led the two countries to diverge.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War soon began.
This war lasted 40 years, with proxy armies fighting with real weapons on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland’s defenses had been breached, and its last hope lay in withdrawing and reorganizing its forces along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were virtually abandoned overnight, following the invasion of eastern Poland – in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties – with over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entering and establishing positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
To date, shipping remains the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of a navy is to ensure a nation maintains the ability to transport its personnel and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, where Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, primarily with U-boats, attempted to intercept this transport.
Had the Allied nations failed at that time, Germany would very likely have conquered Britain as it had conquered other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, and use their milk, meat, wool, and hides for food and materials.
Domestic goats are typically grazed in herds on mountains or other pasturelands, and are usually cared for by goatherds (often children or adolescents), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds. These grazing methods are still in use today.
Britain built dedicated truck lanes as early as the 16th century.
Although the railcars were simply constructed from parallel planks, they allowed horses to pull carts faster and carry heavier loads on the somewhat bumpy roads of the time.
Rail ties were introduced very early on to secure the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing steel plates on the rails would make them more stable and effective.
This became a common practice, but the metal bands caused more severe wear on the wooden cart wheels.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rail line appeared.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. 2 million years ago, with the emergence of *Homo Erectus* (meaning “upright man”), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the ancient apes of the south, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Evidence of bipedal adaptation has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking upright as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more sustainably, join environmental movements, and even become environmental activists, thereby reducing future disasters to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we want more than just a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It is obvious that the world has undergone significant changes due to human scientific and technological advancements, while overpopulation and humanity’s lavish lifestyles have exacerbated these problems.
The handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th and then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, several blocks away, for publication.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed – the edition now widely known as the “Dunlap broadsides.”
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the Independence Hall courtyard.
One of them was mailed to George Washington on July 6th, and Washington read the letter to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the earliest extant versions of this document; the handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and continue to live today, which we call "birds."
Many people believe they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still share many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, or “bits” in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately, and symptoms like vomiting are very common, making an immediate diagnosis difficult.
The most compelling indicator of toxic substance ingestion may be an open container found at the scene, containing medication or common household poisons.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this class of insects.
This term originates from people’s familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and kissing bugs are both nest-dwelling insects, adapted to live in the nests of hosts or in human dwellings.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 people are affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide not to have children due to their own interests, or to consider the interests of their children.
This couple may create an adoption plan for their child.
In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights, allowing another couple to raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In practice, this method can guide most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, however, experiments are not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
The views expressed by Aristotle on issues in all scientific fields (including psychology) were accepted one by one.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers largely depend on the intrinsic cycles generated through biological clocks and their existence.
Periodic rhythms are not merely simple responses to external cyclical signals. These rhythms have been documented in the majority of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating mechanism, a cycle that continues to run freely for a period of time even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the main pieces of evidence demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of bacteriophages, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of bacteriophages.
Mutations can have a wide variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are heritable, while mutations in other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts visitors who are interested in natural areas, and they come to admire the natural scenery including wildlife and plants.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to go to work, and the workplaces of those they pass on the road are precisely the places they are leaving.
In this dynamic flow of traffic, everyone is connected to and supports a car-based transportation system in some way.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the stability of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system, yet almost everyone has complaints about it.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about issues as serious as water quality or bridge collapses.
Why is the transportation system generating so many complaints? Why does it break down every day? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it’s impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often within a reasonable degree of consistency; therefore, traffic flow often exhibits a certain degree of rational uniformity that can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship was established between the following three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were among the first animals to fly in the air. This ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gave them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many others hold the opposite view; they believe the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the Sun as well (even other stars too).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times greater than that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total freshwater discharge into the oceans worldwide.
The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river's water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and sophisticated construction techniques of the Great Pyramid of Giza have never been surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and regulations and official communications.
Italian is also a language used daily by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in nature in their natural forms and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things are composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances, making up everything we see.
Alloys are basically made by mixing two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements are metals, and silver and gold are of course also metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit within the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, as soon as pencils were invented, they became the favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of pencils has declined, and their use has become less and less common.
People now type messages on computer screens, and never have to touch a pencil sharpener again.
People can only speculate as to what will become of keyboards when newer products emerge.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it takes energy to bring a nucleus together with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then split the atomic nucleus again, and release some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to split with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on its near side and approximately 100 kilometers thick on its far side.
The Earth's crust is thinner beneath shadowed areas and thicker beneath highlands.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more shadowed areas, and magma is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of motivational content theory is to identify factors that are relatable or generate interest.
These theories suggest that as people mature and reach adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theories investigate why people want to do the things they do, and what in their environment leads them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers begin to lead former colleagues, two behaviors emerge. One situation is that they will strive to maintain "close relationships" with team members.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and also struggles with implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme scenario, this person would become a completely different individual, feeling they must change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.
After all, leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of their team.
This kind of behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may schedule meetings across different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The 'invisible team' refers to the management team to whom every member reports. It sets standards for all members."
Why does it take an organization so long to become a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality flourish when all available resources are effectively utilized across an organization’s functional departments.
Therefore, an organization often develops new innovative processes to meet customer needs as they work together to overcome obstacles.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and facilitate organized learning.
"Angels" (2006) interprets the contingency approach as a way to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches of cognitive research, thereby narrowing the scope of study and increasing its precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have long known that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to changes in certain cognitive functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain in ways previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models, which helps us understand the process of how the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction element, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling; the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and issues; as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial features.
All of these evolved into independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and some home computers and electronic game software applications already have built-in AI systems.
Field trips are an important component of any teaching activity. Often, teachers are happy to take students to places that are inaccessible by public transport.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or appreciate beautiful artwork in the classroom.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a good way to review the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but older versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students are often careless with grammar and spelling when they first start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most discerning readers, so bloggers are starting to work harder to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging also “forces students to be more insightful about the world around them.” To satisfy audience interest, students are encouraged to become smarter and more engaging.
Blogging is a tool that can foster collaboration and also encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom instruction.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become better at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can locate their own stance within the contextual framework of others' writing and are able to articulate their own viewpoints on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, charming and officially bilingual, with highlights including a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north is the Muskoka River and the pristine natural scenery across the river.
All of this has made Ontario what newcomers envision as the typical face of Canada.
Further north lie vast, sparsely populated areas, with some places being completely uninhabited wilderness.
A surprising demographic comparison: the number of African Americans residing in the United States exceeds the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island, and for wildlife, it remains a self-contained continent.
Smaller islands are mostly independent nations, or belong to France, and are renowned for their luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine flourished in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
It borders the Sahel region to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Woman: It is recommended that all female tourists state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings of what constitutes harassment; and being followed, having one's arm grabbed, and similar situations are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and don't be afraid to stand your ground (reject decisively, regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was later used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, and the port was then known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca (White House), before abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, shops selling Moroccan traditional goods like tagines, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs, as well as various knick-knacks, are everywhere, but these shops are all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the easternmost side of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. Volcanic lava covered most of the town’s streets, especially the town center.
Despite Goma being relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be investigated beforehand to understand if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province has subsided.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for the most affordable gorilla trekking expeditions in Africa.
You can explore Goma by taking a boda-boda (motorbike taxi). A typical (local) price for a short ride is 500 Congolese francs.
Because of its relative remoteness, “Timbuktu” came to be used as a metaphor for a distant, exotic land.
Today, despite Timbuktu's reputation as a tourist destination and the fact that it has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was listed as a World Heritage Site in Danger due to the threat of desertification.
This is a key stop for Henry Louis Gates Jr. on his PBS series, *Wonderful World of the Americas*.
This city stands in stark contrast to others in the country, as it exhibits more Arab than African influences.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for diverse wildlife and plants.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship park of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, this park charges a daily conservation fee and entrance fee.
Buying a Wild Card has quite a few benefits. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region and is the focus of attention for many tourists.
The numerous buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a shimmering bar graph, standing out even more against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong's scenery, you can leave the island and head to the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront across the harbor.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not only mangrove swamps, but also contain remnants of vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that the area currently houses 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most departures, especially those heading east and to Jarkal/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that interval buses are often full, it is recommended to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas have access to comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
To get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges, French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the area of present-day Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the “Great Province of the Indians,” a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has consistently managed to preserve many of the city’s indigenous characteristics and features.
Argentina is renowned for having world-class polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas polo field.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equal in value to the British pound.
You can exchange currency at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound sterling is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted for payment within Stanley as well.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency is; please contact the homeowner in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the islands, so exchange it before leaving.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it’s winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it’s summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter can feel colder than it appears: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than what the thermometer shows.
There isn't a distinct rainy season or dry season here: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and we shouldn't feed or disturb them.
Park officials stated: Maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals have the potential to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured due to failing to keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, be mindful that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong odors, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
This bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
With the exception of one British cruiser, all other ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle initiated by the Mau movement to achieve independence, a peaceful assembly in the town led to the death of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbors, resulting in many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
North Shore Beach (located within North Harbour) is on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Here it’s almost all beach, swimming is very safe, and most areas have shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located in the Waitemata Harbour, between the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families on vacation, and various shops line the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is “No. 1” beer. Its taste isn't complex, but it's very good and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta.”
Here you can buy a lot of French wine, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're still concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, the concept of “馥芮白” (Flat White) coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small black coffee is an “espresso,” cappuccinos have a generous amount of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but the quality is very good.
The Great Barrier Reef is a popular tourist destination throughout the year, and injuries resulting from participation in any of the activities there are rare.
Even so, it is still necessary to follow the advice of the relevant departments, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the beaches and river mouths of 1770 town between October and April each year. They are occasionally sighted at other times as well.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The saltwater crocodile’s primary habitat is not the ocean, but rather the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing they have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually cooperate with specific hotels.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast and airport transfers, and some even offer packages that combine flights and hotel accommodations.
If you need time to consider whether the price is suitable, or need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination, they can reserve the booking for you.
If any modifications are needed or if you have any requests, they should be handled through the travel agency first, rather than contacting the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most of them consider it an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a good spot near the stage.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival might continue playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin's location, as navigating on ice can create extremely frightening noises for those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include city sightseeing tours. Cruise passengers may be eligible for visa-free entry (see terms and conditions for details).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to encourage guests to spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos typically have no windows or clocks, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They typically offer special food, drinks, and entertainment activities to keep guests happy and staying in the casino.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all successful gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-latitude regions or crossing mountain passes should be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, there is very little friction, and you can’t drive as you would on smooth asphalt.
During a blizzard, the snowfall can accumulate quickly enough to trap you.
Snowfall, drifting snow, or water droplets/ice forming on the car window can also obstruct your view.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is very common in many countries, and traffic is rarely interrupted throughout the year.
Safari activities are perhaps the most attractive tourism activity in Africa, and a highlight of many visitors’ itineraries.
The term “safari” commonly refers to traveling by land to observe the stunning wildlife of Africa, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to approach cars, and standard equipment can allow for better viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes afraid of people; you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as “jungle walking,” “long-distance walking,” or “trekking”) primarily involves walking, and typically lasts for several hours or even several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodation before the announcement of the postponement, you may find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, most of the policies implemented due to the coronavirus were not extended to July 2020 – the originally scheduled time for the Olympic Games.
The estimated price for most event tickets will be between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with the average ticket price around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Even if the room doesn't have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer a loan service.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer (if you have one).
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, even scorch them).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific pollutants.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have concerns about this, you should consider purchasing sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are uncommon in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, and in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, transmit venom, or spread infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of violently harming humans, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase duty-free goods at designated locations.
Travelers heading to countries/regions with high excise taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, as it is particularly cost-effective to purchase products like alcohol and tobacco in these locations.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, the most challenging driving conditions are between Point Marion and Fairmont, a stretch that frequently passes through many remote and isolated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, you need to stay alert: they're full of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limit in that area is noticeably lower than on the roads before and after it, typically ranging from 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and adhering to the speed limit is particularly important there.
However, strangely enough, the cell service here is much stronger than on many other routes along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but Bavarian sweets are even more diverse and colorful, very similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are very common, and apples can be used to make pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often a perfect match with strong coffee.
If you're looking for a flavorful little pastry, you could try a jam-filled doughnut – this dessert goes by different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, and Krapfen.
Curry rice is a dish primarily flavored with herbs and spices, and served with meat or vegetables.
Curry rice can be either "dry" or "wet," and how dry or wet it is depends on the amount of water used.
In northern India and inland areas of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; while in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, and therefore Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, without further qualifiers, this term often refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine can be found everywhere on the islands, including many dishes with simple seasonings, and the main seasonings favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
Stirrups hung on either side of the saddle, used to support the rider's feet.
They offer riders better stability, but also pose a safety hazard as riders’ feet can get caught.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag them along as it runs. To minimize this risk, preventative measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear boots with heels, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles—especially English saddles—are equipped with safety stirrups, where the stirrup leathers will detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls backwards on them.
Chile’s premier climbing destination, Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, boasting a variety of granite big walls and cliffs.
From the mountaintop, one can enjoy breathtakingly magnificent scenery. Climbers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes on its seemingly endless cliffs, which serve as a vast climbing wall.
Alpine skiing encompasses both traditional skiing and snowboarding, and is a very popular sport in which skis or a snowboard are fixed to your feet and you glide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many ski enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as “ski fanatics” and plan their entire vacation around skiing in one location.
The idea of skiing has a long history—cave paintings depicting skiers have been found dating back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring (also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking) is an activity where participants explore snow-covered terrain on skis.
This activity is related to Alpine skiing trips or mountaineering, but typically doesn’t involve either of those. Those activities are done on steep terrain and require harder skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a similar hiking trail.
When conditions are good, you can travel further than by walking—but only in rare cases will you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing on a flat track without a heavy pack.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but comprised of many independent countries. Typically, traveling across multiple countries means repeatedly going through visa applications and passport checks.
However, in this regard, the Schengen Area is somewhat like a single country.
As long as you remain in this area, you can usually pass through the border directly without needing to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for visas to each Schengen member state individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no uniform definition of what processed items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
This definition varies by region, with year limitations in North America, for example, potentially being shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, even though their age is often much shorter than that of mass-produced equivalents.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also important to many who make a living in other professions.
However, even considering the traditional sense, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they would make a living by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and typically used reindeer as beasts of burden.
Nowadays, many Sami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for Sápmi, the Sami region.
Despite the widespread use of the term "Gypsy," particularly among non-Roma people, it is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you plan to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is formulated for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information offered elsewhere, the advice provided here tends to be rather rough, general, and overly simplistic.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon; this type of weather can cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. Severe weather comes in many different types, depending on the geographic location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, wildfires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones, are all manifestations and impacts of extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms, among others.
Strongly advise travelers to pay attention to the risk of severe weather in their location, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching online for “hostile environment awareness training” might yield the addresses of local companies offering the training.
This course typically covers all the issues discussed here, often delving into them with practical, hands-on experience.
Course training typically lasts 2-5 days and involves role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes armed training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about survival in war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid identification upon their return.
Whether or not governments are willing to issue passports without a designated gender (X), or whether they are willing to amend documents to align with a desired name and gender, varies from country to country.
The degree of recognition these documents receive from foreign governments also varies widely.
In the era after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery are forced to reveal their privacy and cannot guarantee their dignity when going through scanners.
Rip currents are currents that quickly return waves from the beach to the sea, typically occurring near reefs or similar features.
The underwater terrain causes return flow to concentrate in several deeper areas, where strong currents directed towards the depths may form.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and exhaustion; it’s unlikely to succeed when swimming upstream.
After breaking free from the rapid current, swimming back wasn't so difficult.
Strive to swim towards where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you've been found).
The shock of reverse culture shock comes faster (with a shorter honeymoon period), lasts longer, and can be more severe than culture shock.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be difficult to readjust to their own culture.
After living abroad for a period of time and returning home, you’ll find that you’ve adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your hometown culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding with you, because they know that travelers coming to a new country need time to adjust.
People might not realize that travelers need patience and understanding on their way back as well.
For children, the sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them standing silently there before the show begins.
You can usually hear the voices of tourists and small vendors here. The sounds and sights intertwine, as if telling a touching story.
The backdrop features the Sphinx, which also serves as the narrator of the long story.
The scene is displayed on pyramids, with different pyramids illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several nations claim sovereignty over the islands, and they host the most bases – sixteen were in use on the islands in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas."
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island. There, a still-active crater has been flooded, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula merge here into the plateau, then reform into the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which were bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The north, or Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak, Vinson Peak, reaching 4,892 meters.
In remote areas with no mobile phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Generally speaking, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones, as calls can only be made outdoors with a clear satellite signal.
This service is frequently used in shipping, including yachts and expeditions requiring remote data and voice capabilities.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide details about connecting to this service.
For those planning how to spend their gap year, studying abroad is becoming an increasingly popular choice.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before university without interrupting their education.
In many cases, participating in a gap year program abroad can substantially improve your chances of being accepted into a university upon your return to China.
Typically, tuition is required to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is a superb sailing mecca, famously known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," and contains thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not essential.
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is sufficient to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats, even kayaks, can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with approximately one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand experience similar situations, but are quite unique in other respects (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises spend a significant amount of time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means there could be several full days to explore this historic city, and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you are only disembarking for a cruise visit, a separate visa is not required (regulation as of 2009).
Some cruise lines highlight Berlin, Germany in their brochures. However, as seen on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and the cruise price does not include excursions to the city.
Traveling by airplane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially for those who have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This isn't something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fear and disgust many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and the procedures of flight may be helpful in overcoming the fear caused by the unknown or uncontrollable situations.
Courier companies can earn high compensation for the rapid delivery of goods. Often, time is critical for business documents, merchandise, or parts needed for emergency repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there are problems.
If they ship goods by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The fastest way is to check it as baggage. According to airline regulations, carrying baggage for passengers who are not on board is prohibited, and that requires your presence.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to spend a significant amount of money to enjoy the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it).
However, it’s not cheap: a rough estimate suggests business class tickets could be four times the price of a standard economy ticket, and first class could be as much as eleven times higher!
Generally speaking, when flying directly from city A to city B, there's absolutely no need to look for discounted business or first-class tickets.
Airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and therefore they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered greatly from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova. The republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova were rebuilt.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is Turkey's second-busiest port, after Istanbul, and also a major transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by vast bays and mountains.
Between the broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers, are scattered traditional red-tiled roofs, 18th-century markets, and ancient mosques and churches, though the city feels more Mediterranean-European than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy. The village features a unique octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, some of the graves are adorned with interesting marble dove sculptures.
A half-hour stroll through this charming village is worthwhile.
Traveling north, you can easily reach the romantic and charming town of Sintra, a paradise praised by Lord Byron and well-known to foreigners as a result.
Scotturb bus line 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cape Roca.
You can also visit the Shrine of Fatima in the north (a holy site), which is world-renowned as the place where the Virgin Mary appeared.
Please remember, you are actually visiting the site of a massive mass grave, a site of immeasurable significance to a large group of people worldwide.
Still, many men and women survived here, and some of them are still alive today; while more people’s families—some were massacred there, others were forced into hard labor until they died—both Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not mark or graffiti on buildings, so as not to damage the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand it, while almost everyone can understand Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language required by law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
The regular announcements on the subway are only in Catalan, but the automated system makes temporary announcements in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are notorious for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris is still to behave as properly as possible and present yourself as someone with “bien élevé” (good upbringing/manners). This will make participating in social activities much easier.
If you show even a little basic politeness, the rudeness of Parisians will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park boasts lush forests primarily composed of beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimates, soil types, and altitudes, the plant communities here are exceptionally rich and renowned worldwide.
The area is also home to various animals and birds.
There you can see rare animals such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie, as well as many more common species.
Women visiting the monastery must wear skirts that reach the knees, and their shoulders must be covered.
Most monasteries will provide shawls for women who aren’t prepared, but if you bring your own—especially a brightly colored one—the monks at the gate will give you a knowing smirk.
Similarly, gentlemen must also wear long pants, covering their knees.
You can also borrow them from the cloakroom at the entrance, but the clothes aren’t washed every time someone wears them, so these dresses might not be very comfortable. They are all one size fits all!
Mallorca's cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean regions, is based primarily on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil exclusively.
Pa amb Oli is a simple dinner particularly popular in summer: bread with olive oil and tomato, with any available toppings added, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except for those representing "Sie" (formal you), should be capitalized, even mid-sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
This can also make reading easier, although it makes writing more complex to some extent, as you need to judge whether a verb or adjective is being used as a nominalization.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because the pronunciation of most words is exactly the same as their spelling.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Additionally, it’s necessary to ensure distinct pronunciations for 'r' and 'rr': “caro” means “dear,” while “carro” means “wheeled vehicle/carriage.”
Persian grammar is mostly relatively simple and follows discernible patterns.
Therefore, reading this grammar introductory book can help you master more Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
There's no doubt that if you speak a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be much easier.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish might rush to the conclusion that Portuguese is very close to Spanish and doesn't need to be learned separately.
Today, most pre-modern observatories have been phased out, remaining only as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as severe during its heyday, observatories were typically built in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote areas with excellent atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as “hanami,” has been a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
This concept originated in China, and the plum blossom is a flower that the Chinese people love to see and hear about.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the Emperor for himself and other aristocratic members of the Imperial family in the Imperial Palace.
Plants are at their best when left in their natural environment. Therefore, resist the temptation not to pick them, even if it’s “just one.”
If you visit a carefully landscaped garden, collecting “specimens” will also get you kicked out, no exceptions.
Generally speaking, Singapore is a very safe place, and it’s also easy to get around. You can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, due to being located a few degrees north of the equator in the "hyper-tropical" zone, you will need to cope with both high temperatures (year-round) and intense sunlight (though this is relatively less frequent on cloudy days).
Several buses also headed north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Please confirm that the bus you intend to take will enter Hebron, and not just go to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for holiday recreation.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to explore the charming cities along the Danube River, or enjoy a boat trip along the Ille Canal.
They also clearly marked routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many traditions associated with this festival have also been embraced by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of staying awake outdoors somewhere on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has its Christian theological explanation, but it was likely a ritual celebrating spring and praying for a good harvest that existed before the birth of Christ.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with the congregation typically surging into the celebration as the midnight bells chime, commemorating the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, the animals reached these islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the islands are far from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel long distances to reach them, making giant tortoises the primary herbivores of the Galápagos Islands.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience polar night, a period of time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for more or less the entire day.
These areas are sparsely populated, and generally don't suffer from light pollution, allowing you to enjoy a brilliant starry sky.
Compared to the work culture commonly found in Western countries, the work culture in Japan exhibits a more pronounced and formal hierarchical system.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
A harmonious work environment is crucial, emphasizing team effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors before making any decisions, and are required to unconditionally obey their instructions.
