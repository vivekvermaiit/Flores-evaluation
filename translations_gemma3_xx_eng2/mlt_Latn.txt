“Now we have 4-month-old mice that are not diabetic, which previously were,” he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and president of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association, warned that the research is still in its early stages.
Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured, and notes that these findings have no relevance for people who already have Type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature at the Swedish Academy, publicly announced during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden that the committee, having failed to contact Bob Dylan directly regarding the awarding of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, had abandoned its efforts to reach him.
Danius said, "Currently, we aren't doing anything. I called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very cordial replies. For now, this is certainly enough."
Previously, Ring’s former CEO, Jamie Siminoff, noted that the company started when his doorbell wasn’t audible from his shop in the garage.

A single antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed potential in the field, but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than hoped for in preventing death.
In the PALM test, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress with significant change within our organization, rather than by removing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of power described with so much courage by those saved from Larry Nassar remained hidden for so long and embraces any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.

Turkey will also take over guarding ISIS fighters who have been captured, the statement said, after European nations refused to repatriate them.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely circulated, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists state that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and the underside is pale or carotenoid-colored.
The research also provides information about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – “barbs” and “barbules” – researchers have deduced that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the thin, downy feathers of juveniles.
Researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy fur.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic reconnection.

The 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
This will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the base station has dual radios.
The speeds of 802.11n are significantly faster than those of its predecessors, with a theoretical maximum throughput of 600Mbit/s.
Duvall, who is married with two grown children, did not make much of an impression on Miller, to whom the story had been related.

He did not set a figure for the reduction, and said these will be based on China’s economic output.
He urged developing countries "to avoid the outdated path of first pollute and then clean up afterwards."
He added that, "however, they are being asked to assume obligations that go beyond their stage of development, responsibility and capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12:00 GMT today.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any action taken in Iraq at this point will stop the sectarian war, the escalating violence, or descent into chaos.
The report begins with a call for an open debate and the formation of consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report strongly criticises almost every aspect of the Executive’s current policy regarding Iraq and urges an immediate change in direction.
The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile intervention and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbours.
The current senator and First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) away from Buenos Aires.
Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentinian Theatre, the same place she used to launch her 2005 campaign for Senate as a member of the delegation from the province of Buenos Aires.
The debate was sparked by a controversy over spending on aid and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina; which some fiscal conservatives humorously referred to as "Bush's New Orleans Deal."
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort focused on awarding reconstruction contracts to those perceived as Washington insiders.

Community outrage has led to current efforts to draft a policy regarding sexual content for the site that hosts millions of openly licensed media.
The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon has a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Path of Saint Anne exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have reached the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities are advising residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off their air conditioners and not drink tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "worrying and very alarming due to the very high fatality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the bug in hospital, and at least two were hospital healthcare workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any particular time in South Africa.

She took the officers near her black Oldsmobile Intrigue which was 500 feet away.
There, they found the body of Sarojha Balasubramanian, 53, covered in blood-stained blankets.
The police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.
The first cases of the illness this season were reported at the end of July.
The disease is carried by sandflies, which then migrate to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak led the Indian government to implement measures such as the deployment of pig catchers in severely affected areas, the distribution of thousands of mosquito nets, and the spraying of pesticides.
The government has also pledged several million doses of encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccinations to the areas historically most affected this year have been delayed due to a lack of funds and low prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania went to Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish Post Office and became their chief engraver.
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is of such quality and detail, so widely recognised, that he is one of the very few “well-known names” amongst philatelists. Some specialise in collecting his work alone.
His 1,000th bubble was the excellent “Great Deeds by Swedish Kings” (Magnificent Works done by Swedish Kings) by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl in the year 2000, which is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
He was also involved in the engraving of banknotes for many countries, recent examples of his work including the portraits of the Prime Minister on the front of the Canadian $5 and $100 banknotes.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal flooding stopped, which had been spreading sediment throughout the river.
This sediment was necessary for the creation of sandbanks and sand beaches, which served as habitats for wildlife.
Because of this, two species of fish became extinct, and two others became threatened species, including the humpback chub.
Even though the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, officials are hoping this will be enough to restore the sandbars that have disappeared further down the river.

All the entrances to the caves, known as "Is-Seba' Aħwa Bniet" (The Seven Sister Caves), have a diameter of at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
Infrared signatures show that temperature variations throughout the night and day likely indicate caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding area during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn’t as constant as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly steady temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep pits in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed paper ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter’s identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voters’ list.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a rather strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of counted and duly authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

UN peacekeeping forces, who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are being accused of spreading the disease that began near where the troops were stationed.
According to the cause, waste from the UN camp was not properly sanitized, and this caused bacteria to enter a tributary of the Artibonite River, one of Haiti's largest.
Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not experienced problems related to disease since the 1800s.
The Haiti Institute for Justice and Democracy referred to independent studies suggesting that the Nepalese UN peacekeeping battalion unintentionally brought cholera to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a UN expert on the disease, said the outbreak was likely caused by peacekeepers.

Schneider testified via video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
Apart from the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual heats at the Championships.
Her first event was the Slalom, where she received a “Did Not Finish” (DNF) in her first run. 36 out of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her last race, the Giant Slalom, she finished tenth in the women’s sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Austrian Claudia Loesch who took first place, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungary’s Gyöngyi Dani who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's seated group did not manage to finish their runs, and 45 out of the 117 skiers in total in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, I was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court since that time, accused of killing her son.
She is being held in custody until she is charged and prosecuted, but any eyewitness testimony may be compromised as her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice in other police forces in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists appear to be putting themselves in danger if they publish photos etc. of suspected individuals."
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least not before the arraignment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
Shooters during the supplementary pest control test had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Association of Sports Shooting Enthusiasts’ hunting program (“Sporting Shooters Association”).
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Regional Director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instruction in safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due in 2011.
Around 60 cases of faulty iPods due to overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been informed of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had been informed of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company describes as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage across the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino individual, formerly a police officer, held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate preterm labour in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it accelerates the lung maturation of the baby's fetus.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two "black boxes" which are the flight recorders.
Supporters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Truly one of a kind like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna wasn’t normal like me…perhaps even more so than me…I loved her and miss her…I hope she’s in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percentage points from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic when the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the polling, 29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there were doubts about his health.
He couldn't take the necessary medication for his pain because they are prohibited by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software until the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, began governing earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing marriage between same-sex couples.
He referred to the rumours as "words and political foolishness".
He speculated that he would be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
This uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater accuracy and provide mariners with more precise information.
No extra transport is being provided and the overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley, and car parks and ‘park-and-ride’ facilities are unavailable on site.
Fears of a lack of transport have raised the possibility that the game may be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal “Science” provided a report on the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer, due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be braided and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of chemistry. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine the two dry ingredients together and then, with wet and clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a sort of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets also in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women would meet together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A rocket over 100 feet long is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in unbelievable ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us is that it gave us easier and faster transportation.
He brought with him the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat very numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their secret to success is the concept of a niche, a special task that each cat has and which doesn’t allow it to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and live in large groups which are called “prides” in English.
The groups (“prides”) consist of one to three related adult males, together with a maximum of thirty females and offspring.
Women, generally, are closely related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
June bugs behave like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behaviour, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good all-round athlete, the tiger can scratch (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times its own weight – exceeding the strength of a healthy human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar powerfully.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the lion’s loud bellow, but more like a sentence of words mumbled awkwardly.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch rabbits, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from – such as if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so they can’t easily move back – they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look increasingly dissimilar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands of years, or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they won’t even be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe in, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaw was filled with over 70 sharp, cutting teeth, as well as another set of teeth on the roof of her mouth, meaning anyone who crossed her path had no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it’s possible he had a forked tongue. His diet included plesiosaurs, large fish, mosasaurs, and he might even have been cannibalistic.
He attacked everything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't win against him.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans in fact had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, dormice, snails, and a type of rodent resembling a very sleepy mouse.
Another difference was that while poor people and women would eat their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to have lunch together where they would recline on their sides while eating their meal.
The meals of Ancient Rome could not have included food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, garlic, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted vanilla.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The peak of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't quite as important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life was lived outdoors.
Women used to do the cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Kanghan, therefore wood was immensely expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and when he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of the discovery he made, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, rulers, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film “National Treasure”, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4th, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large document made of parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it's likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but the South remained still unfree.
It was run by the French "Vichy" regime. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were turning towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large and significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, society.
The word civilisation comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civil, related to the Latin words *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and which in a way also defines the size of a society.
Cities that have existed are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from various generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and just dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognised as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, these did not cooperate.
He had no strength to overcome the laws of taxation and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago."
The history of Taiwan dates back to the early 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and began a transformation in the production practices of indigenous wheat and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
A large part of the buildings around the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists have a clearer idea of how they originally looked.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format for a still image in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The rule of thirds, often abused and ridiculed, is simply a guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the sultan to the common villagers.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church’s financial funds are specifically there for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it halted vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering large sections of the ocean, thereby causing danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Over the past 20 years, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations have been those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the terrible events and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different periods of time; each stage of China and each family that held power were distinctive dynasties.
Also, between each dynasty there was a period of instability with the provinces divided. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, where thousands of people died fighting to take the highest seat in the magnificent palace within Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed those who were the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on class, army ranks were now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He would frequent a cave that became known as “Hira” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has persisted through time, clearly demonstrates Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
On the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy at all to find, even if someone knows it exists. Once you go inside the cave, there is total isolation.
Nothing could be seen except a clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains all around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest among them), various small crypts, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were constructed to honor the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The “up tick” mark looks like a V and the “down tick” mark like a staple or a square shape without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Playing upwards on a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while playing downwards is louder and more assertive.
You can make the markings you want with a pencil, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and therefore, usually, they should be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King’s sister, Madame Elizabeth, distressed, on October 6th, 1789 were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a violent crowd of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people jeering and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage open wide.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of the royal guard who was killed inside Versailles before the Queen who was distraught.
The costs of the United States’ imperialist war in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the bulk of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events occurred was commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
Before the High Middle Ages there was the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a road network throughout the country is not economically viable for just a few cars, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increasing ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged vehicle bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and a culture related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
His status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bearing gifts such as silk and spices which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Firstly, the clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow pace of communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses saved seeds native to the eco-region along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think alike and feel forgotten by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often indicate their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style, including fashion, manners, and language.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or savage. Some feral children have been locked up by people (generally their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability of the children.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are alleged to have grown up with animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
When raised completely by non-human animals, the wild creature displays behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals that raised it, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, a teaching method called scaffolding is more effective.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised within the software and aims to question, prompt, and explain procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No children should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but this still happens.
We consider the Foster Care System as a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is meant to provide safe homes, nurturers who offer their love, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which the child was taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and satisfactions.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as novel aspects of motivation when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the facial movements that last for milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document “The President’s Speech”, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
He boldly suggests that skills such as these in interpreting human behaviour also exist in animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation increases new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were easily accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast to this, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high quantity of protein containing all essential amino acids.
When all is considered, we shouldn't boast that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees living in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process where you wake up intentionally during your normal sleep period and go back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet revealer that brings you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm while you’re asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, and this will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, thereby forcing the person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find peace and absolute contentment.
Everyone can become enlightened. The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they were expanded with the compassion of Mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the idea that love accepts everything.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (illuminated energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation lies the Yoga of the Gods. Through the visualization of various deities, one purifies the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates an awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was still a commonality during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, disagreement in the system, process, and culture led to countries fighting each other.
Only two years after the end of the war, those who had previously been allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She was destined to last for the next 40 years and was to be fiercely fought over, by opposing forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defence had already been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and objects across the oceans.
The job of the navy has traditionally been to ensure your country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which primarily used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had fallen, Germany would likely have been able to defeat Great Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to have an easy way to obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in goat pens located on hillsides or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These methods of guarding the pens are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England early in the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat more refined roads of that time.
“Crossties” (interlocking ties) were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron lines were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) emerged.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs even earlier, as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. Despite this, if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems, and we need to deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly due to humanity’s scientific and technological advancements, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, instructing that it be read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 broadsides of Dunlap still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and pointed claws, they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis may not be possible.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with fleas, which are very well-suited insects as human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are loathsome, adapted to live in nests or on their host’s body.
Around the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child’s parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides much of scientific research.
However, it is not solely experimentation—an experiment being a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations—that guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external cues, have been documented for the vast majority of living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that sustain themselves to continue a period of free-running cycling even without external cues.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, taking photos, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns of the country by car to go to work, passing others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport hub, everyone is, in some way, connected to and supports a car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear levels of concern similar to those about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems create complaints like these, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two locations and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because drivers’ behaviour cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically to a certain extent.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to develop the ability to fly. Their capacity to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The vast majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places it has a width of six miles.
Overall, 20 percent of all the water discharged by the world’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the main river, stretching 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the largest in size and the finest in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which, at that time, were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the everyday language used by many of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as all of these can be discovered in nature in native form and it is relatively simple to mine them using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorizes that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have an alloy that includes small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as better writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now write messages on computer screens, and never have to approach a typewriter.
Who knows what will become of the keyboard when something newer is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is released when a nucleus is split into many protons and neutrons.
Similarly to when pushing a heavy cart uphill. The fission of the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to split with very little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km wide on the closest side and 100 km wide on the furthest side.
He is thinner under the “maria” and thicker under the “highlands”.
There may be more lunar maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centred on discovering what makes people happy or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyse what drives certain people to want the things they want and which aspects of their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can result when managers begin to manage those who were previously their peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain perceived as one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary action, conduct evaluations, assign responsibilities, and ensure people are accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and mark it as their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behaviour often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a conventional team because their teams can meet according to varying time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the managerial team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for practically implementing the concepts of a learning organization is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively within an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the client’s needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Sequencing approach as a method being used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to investigating cognition. Therefore, this makes the field of research less broad and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
For a long time it has been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in machines.
Research on AI involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like these have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as being built into various computer software applications for home use and video games.
Field trips are a big part of every class. Often, teachers like to take their students to places that are inaccessible by public transport.
Technology offers the solution with virtual trips on-site. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a travel experience on location virtually with others is also a very good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capitol, and every year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve students’ writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the fact that they have an audience generally leads to this situation changing.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts working to improve their writing so as not to be criticised.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to satisfy audience interest inspires students to be more relevant and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students will be able to define their positions in the context of others’ writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital city of Canada and features a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south there are the Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more emphasize Ontario as the perfect example of what foreigners consider to be Canadian.
Larger islands further north have a rather sparse population and some are areas in a natural state, almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts on beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it spread widely in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahara, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Advice: It is recommended that any woman who is travelling states that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's useful to wear a ring too (but not one that looks like it costs a lot of money).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in what they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to insist on your preference (even if there are cultural differences or not, it doesn’t mean you have to accept everything as okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as his royal residence and it was given the name “Casablanca” by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but they are all touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city’s roads, particularly the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched to ascertain the state of the fighting that still persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for visiting the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" was used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the key stops during Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special series “Wonders of the African World.”
The city contrasts sharply with the other cities in the country, because it has more Arabic than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own unique wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation fees and park entry fees apply.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The silhouette of the buildings forming Hong Kong’s skyline has been compared to a sharply defined bar with shimmering light due to how it appears with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took as their own, and therefore if you are looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only mangroves in swampy lands – they include some of the last remaining stands of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about a third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (along the river) throughout the day, although many of them, especially those going to the East and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Since buses between districts are often crowded, it is recommended to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts have services by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two carriages 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group living in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields inside Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller games may also appear here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although English and US currency may be; speak to the owners beforehand to see what payment methods are acceptable.
It’s almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it will be summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively mild: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't any particular "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they may seem, bison, elk, moose (large North American deer), bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
However, you should be aware that winds attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict in 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of key leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland lies between two harbours. The most well-known are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and the majority have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sandy beaches for families that are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One”, it’s not a complex beer, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines you can find, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
The local tap water is good for drinking, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee called “flat white” is unfamiliar. A “short black” is an “espresso”, a cappuccino comes filled with lots of cream (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is to Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the docks are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the docks are rare.
Nevertheless, you should seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and be very careful about safety messages.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be seen outside of these times.
Although seals exist, they rarely attack people. Many seals are afraid of people and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
If one books in advance, the traveller will have peace of mind knowing they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport, and even packages that combine flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any amendment or request for anything should be passed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of those who attend music festivals decide to camp on site, and many of them consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you need to arrive early to have a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may be over, there might be festival areas that continue playing music late into the night.
Do some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children?
If you are going to cross the North Baltic in winter, pay close attention to the location of the cabin, as when passing through the ice it makes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent within them by guests. There are generally no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
Generally, they have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay.
Some places offer alcoholic drinks for free. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there isn't much friction and you can’t drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During strong snowstorms, in a short time enough snow can fall for you to get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic generally continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to travelling overland to observe the wild and marvelous African animals, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and near equipment providing good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or “going "footing"”) consists of a hike, lasting for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be organised in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, as it already hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March many of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended past July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Hanging clothes to dry can help them to dry faster. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available for use, even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don’t have a travel iron, or if you don’t want to wear ironed socks, you could try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which could cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, letting the water run for a minute is enough, while in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter stray animals they are not familiar with in the regions they visit.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, poisoning, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it frequently passes through remote stretches of backwoods.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there’s a prevalence of steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp bends.
The speed limits are considerably lower than in the preceding and following sections – commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than elsewhere.
However, curiously, the mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is quite good, and in Bavaria, it is rich and varied, similar to that of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit dishes are common, and cooked apples are used in dishes throughout the year, while cherries and figs begin to appear in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts from other trees. These well-known cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
The curry is typically based on spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be “thick” or “watery” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Because there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a general term encompassing the great variety of regional cooking found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes a range of simply spiced dishes, and the predominant flavourings favoured by Javanese people are candlenuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the feet of the rider that hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather tight fit.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have a safety strap that allows the saddle’s leather girth to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley (Wied Cochamó) – Chile’s main rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large granite and rock walls.
The highest points include spectacular views from the cliffs. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amongst the endless potential of its walls.
Snow sports for descending, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding downhill on snow-covered ground on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called “backcountry ski”, “ski touring” or “ski hiking”.
He is related to it, but generally doesn't involve ski touring or alpine-style mountaineering, the latter of which is done on standing ground and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski run as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than if you walk – but it is very rare indeed that you will get “cross country” skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries. Usually, to travel through several countries you need to go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you remain in this area, you will generally be able to cross the borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don’t need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many people with other professions.
Even traditionally, despite this, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and had reindeer primarily as animals to pull heavy loads.
Today, many Sámi work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romans, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You could also consider consulting the advice of other governments, not just your own, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
A consultative report is a brief summary of the political situation in one country.
The opinions presented are often hasty, general and oversimplified when compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, snow, excessive rain, and wildfires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, ice pellets, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone organizing a visit to a country that can be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching on the internet for “Hostile Environment Course” will likely return the address of a local company.
A course normally covers all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, generally with practical experience.
The course usually lasts between 2-5 days and involves role play, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but there aren't many publications about war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to align with a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies just as widely.
Security checkpoint searches also became far more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow returning from a breaking wave away from the shore, often in a channel or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and it can form a strong current towards the deep water there.
Many deaths occur due to exhaustion after someone tries to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it won't be any more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim for somewhere you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been noticed, you might prefer to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry is more significant than culture shock (there’s a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more intense.
Travellers who find it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your country's culture.
When you travel, at first people probably had patience and understood you, because they know that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for returning travellers.
The pyramid’s sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show begins.
Generally, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of the sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with eighteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, where the sunken caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the Antarctic Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into the plain, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The Northern Party or Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with a peak reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones generally don't replace mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate remotely via voice and data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A choice that is becoming increasingly popular among those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with those finishing school, allowing them to take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during a gap year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a very good destination for sailing. The "Land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger bays are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the figure is one for every forty).
Many of the distinguished cruises within the Baltic include an extended visit to Saint Petersburg, in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while at night you return and sleep on the ferry.
If you disembark on land only using excursions booked onboard, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and personal aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, if they understand a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight, this can help them overcome a fear that is based on what they don’t know or on things they have no control over.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in the case of commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent the cargo by air, on some routes it could have taken days to pass through customs and clearance.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a thick wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this won't be cheap: as a rough guide, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business class and first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain important group of air travelers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they charge for these things.
The capital city of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling business center, built around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional stone buildings, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
You wouldn't mind spending half an hour wandering around the intriguing village.
Towards the north and easily reached there is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after the highly praising description of its great beauty expressed by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Moreover, in the North, visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Chapel), a place where the Marian apparitions are known throughout the world.
Please remember that, essentially, you are visiting a mass grave site, as well as a site that holds almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive today who managed to survive throughout the time they were there, and many more who had their loved ones killed or destroyed to death there, Jews as well as non-Jews.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. More or less, half the people prefer to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows how to speak Spanish.
However, the majority of signs are only marked in Catalan because this is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, cold, and arrogant people.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to carry yourself well and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This helps considerably to make things easier for yourself.
The unfriendly attitudes of Parisians quickly melt away when you show them basic politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in many trees, mainly beech, spruce and pine trees, and contains a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area also welcomes an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the falcon, the lynx, the wild cat and the wild rabbit can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Many monasteries provide habits for women who don't come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly coloured one, you’ll receive a smile from the father or sister at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear shorts that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock available at the entrance, but those items aren’t washed after each person wears them, and therefore you might not feel comfortable wearing these robes. For men, there’s a one-size-fits-all!
The cooking of Mallorca, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and available toppings such as cheese, tuna in oil, etc.
All nouns, next to the word "You" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
Certainly, this facilitates reading, although the writing is slightly complicated due to the need to know whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters you need to pay attention to are “c” and “g”, because their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel follows them.
Apart from that, be sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: caro means expensive, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Obviously, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, remaining as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at its peak wasn’t the type of problem we have now, these are generally found in cities or campuses, and they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing, known as “hanami”, has been part of Japanese culture since as early as the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the frog lily was the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing festivals were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy only around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, therefore, resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also lead to you being kicked out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when placed in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to face both the heat (always) as well as the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visits to castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruises to interesting cities on the Danube, or journeys by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular trails for long walks and cycling.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the feast have also been adopted by those who do not believe in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter Sunday night in an exposed place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often organize a Good Friday procession on Saturday evening throughout the Easter weekend, and congregations frequently begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating here.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey and therefore the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, numerous mammals have been introduced, including goats, pigs, cattle, rats, cats and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be quite dark for the most part.
Because these areas have a low population, and light pollution therefore often doesn’t cause problems, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people in the West are accustomed to.
Suits are standard work attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis placed on team effort rather than encouraging individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without reservation.
