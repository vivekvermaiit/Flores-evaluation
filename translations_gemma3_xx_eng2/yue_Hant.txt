This not only confirms the widely circulated theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal’s feathers are chestnut-colored at the tips and pale or carotenoid-colored at the base.
This discovery also allows us to understand the evolution of bird feathers more deeply.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked developed feather quills (known as “rachises”), but possessed other feather characteristics (barbs and barbules), researchers infer that the rachis likely evolved later as a subsequent development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers believe that although this is from the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers, not juvenile plumage.
Researchers believe that despite being a young dinosaur’s tail, the sample displays feathers of an adult dinosaur, not juvenile feathers.

They discovered that the principles governing the movement of the sun and other stars are the same: the activity of all stars in a system is driven by their luminosity and rotation, and not by other factors.
Both luminosity and rotation are used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flows.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in magnetic reversals.

The completed research is mostly theoretical in nature, but this program was written to simulate observations of the Andromeda Galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for is caused by the tidal gravity between the dark matter of galaxies and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon's gravity on Earth creates tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational pull on the Andromeda Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter’s influence on other dark matter is the same as its influence on ordinary matter.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo-like region around the galaxy, and is composed of many small particles.

Their thermal states aren't as stable as large caves on Earth, which typically maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the conditions of these deep underground voids," said Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters are alone in a voting booth, filling in their chosen candidates on a pre-printed ballot, then placing it in an envelope.
After election workers verify the identity of voters, voters will place the ballot envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter registry.
French electoral law adopts relatively strict criteria in codifying election procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting, and that only ballots properly checked and authorized by eligible voters are placed inside – no additional ballots are added.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the election process. In the evening, volunteers counted the ballots under strict supervision, following designated procedures.

Her other competition was the giant slalom, where she finished tenth in the women's overall category with a combined time of 4 minutes 41 seconds 30, 2 minutes 11 seconds 60 slower than the first-place Austrian athlete Claudia Rausch, and 1 minute 09 seconds 02 slower than the ninth-place Hungarian athlete Dani Koncsol.
Four members of the women's alpine skiing team failed to finish the competition, and out of a total of 117 athletes in the giant slalom event, 45 did not achieve a ranking.
Central police found the stolen laptop and phone.
Deputy Commissioner D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people in connection with the rape of the Swiss woman, and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the defendant appeared in court with their face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, fortunately no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road at the scene of the car accident is temporarily closed to allow emergency personnel to rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital under Dr. Tai Yeung-fook.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterward, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son and stood trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is currently being detained, awaiting indictment and trial, but due to the widespread circulation of her photos, any eyewitness testimony may be compromised.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system is different, and the courts believe publishing the photos could constitute prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University pointed out, “It seems dangerous if journalists publish photos of suspects, and so on.”
The UK's Crown Prosecution Service, fully responsible for the prosecution, told reporters it would not be making further comment, at least before the prosecution begins.
According to leaked information, this document concerns a border dispute, in which Palestine hopes to base its claims on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other discussion topics included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and issues related to the Jordan River.
Israel is demanding to maintain a military presence in the Jordan Valley for 10 years after the signing of a ceasefire agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to an Israeli military presence for 5 years.
Shooters participating in the supplementary trial for pest control will be closely supervised by forest rangers, and the trial will also be monitored with its effectiveness being assessed.
National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is collaborating with the NSW Sporting Shooters Association to recruit qualified volunteers to participate in the Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Director of Park Conservation and Cultural Resources for National Park and Wildlife Service, the four shooters selected for the first cull operation have undergone comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Malta Lee swore in the establishment of a temporary election committee (CEP) comprised of nine members yesterday.
This is the fifth CEP in the past four years for Malteel.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP resign as part of a set of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This committee is a response by Maltese to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
These protests were triggered by the lack of elections (some of which haven’t been held since 2011), and have at times escalated into violent clashes.
Approximately 60 reports have been received of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that authorities have noted 27 incidents related to the device.
METI announced last week that Apple has reported an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents, which the company considers to be “not serious.”
The provincial/departmental response stated that Apple’s delay in releasing the report was “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake in Mariana occurred at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reports that the territory has not received any reports of damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami at the time.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the Philippine capital, and held them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, and a Filipino photographer have been released early.
Later, those photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Likins followed in his father’s footsteps and began his medical career.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Lee Kin-sang began using his free time to research the issue of premature birth.
His research shows that administering a hormone will accelerate fetal lung development.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna is the original Extreme Queen and also my first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night, as unique and strong as she was."
Dustin Runnels (known as Goldust) commented: “Luna was as quirky and mischievous as I was… perhaps even more so than me… I loved her and I will miss her… I hope she’s gone to a better place.”
Among 1,400 respondents interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II’s reign ends.
34% of respondents share the same view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia’s last monarch.
From an extreme perspective, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was originally scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as the medley relay, at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have led to ongoing questions about his health.
He has been unable to take the medication needed to overcome the pain, as these drugs are banned by the Olympics.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
In early February, several people verified the finding using different hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, substances that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Fifty-three-year-old Como began serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described these rumors as "political noise and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says the NextGen system can shorten aircraft flight paths, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than the outdated technology of ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be provided, and trains will not stop at Wembley; there are also no parking facilities or park-and-ride options available on the ground.
Due to public concerns about a lack of transportation, the competition may be forced to be held behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in the journal *Science* on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that it has long been thought that evolution takes a long time, but due to the interbreeding of local Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortes) and introduced cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be crafted into different shapes, and also rolled into fine, delicate forms.
It can be drawn into fine filaments, then twisted and braided. It can also be pressed or rolled into sheets.
Gold can also be made into extremely thin leaves and adhered to other metals. Sometimes it's so thin it can be used to decorate the hand-painted illustrations in books, a technique known as “gold-leaf manuscript illumination.”
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can use purple cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color change of cabbage juice depends on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substance.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton with its electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then squeeze them into a ball shape with clean, slightly wet hands.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layer of the substance, resulting in a strange feel and forming a shell-like appearance.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses had flushing toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the Minoan towns and houses on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, and men and women would use them together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space will reflect phone signals back almost immediately after receiving them.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
A huge rocket needs to be over 100 feet tall to send a satellite or telescope into space.
Wheels have changed the world in an extraordinary way. The greatest contribution of the wheel is giving us simpler and faster transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other different kinds of transportation.
Below them are mid-sized feline animals, whose medium-sized prey includes rabbits, gazelles, and deer.
Finally, many small feline animals (including free-roaming pet cats) will consume a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success lies in appropriate division of labor; each cat is assigned a specific task, allowing them to avoid competition with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, living in groups called prides.
A lion pride consists of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Female macaques typically have close relationships with each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides is similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs; their actions are surprisingly like those of lions (but unlike other large felines), and are extremely deadly to prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes, capable of climbing (though not particularly skilled at it), swimming, long-distance leaping, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars are all members of the same genus (the panther genus). Among felines, only these four types are capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar is distinct from the lion’s loud bellow, and is more akin to a growl with bared teeth.
Leopard cats enjoy eating small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all animals hunted by leopard cats are much smaller in size than the cats themselves.
Scientists believe leopard cats use their sense of smell to detect where prey animals have been on the ground in order to find food (prey).
They have excellent night vision in the dark and can move silently. Black-footed cats hunt by first blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a population of limited size) becomes separated from the parent population from which they originated (for example, by crossing mountains or rivers, or migrating to a new island and being unable to easily return), they will typically find themselves in a different environment than before.
In a new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so this new group needs to develop habits or adaptability that are different from before in order to become stronger competitors than they were previously.
The original ethnic groups haven't changed at all; they still need the same adaptability as before.
As time passed, this new group began to adapt to the new environment, and their differences from another group gradually increased.
Finally, after being tempered by thousands or even millions of years, these two groups of organisms will look drastically different and will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants release oxygen that humans need to breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and as such, they feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
It has a long jaw filled with over 70 razor-sharp, knife-like teeth, and extra teeth on its upper jaw, meaning nothing in its path can escape.
We aren't sure, but it may have a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have eaten its own kind.
It also attacks everything in the water. Even a massive dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex couldn't match it.
Although much of their food was similar to ours, the Romans also had their own peculiar tastes and unusual banquet fare, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
Another distinction is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the wealthy prefer to lie on their sides together at banquets for meals.
Food in ancient Rome could not have included ingredients that were only transported to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, the ancient Romans did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa beans, nor had they ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians would build a main temple for each deity, and that temple was considered the deity’s home.
People offer sacrifices to deities, and priests attempt to satisfy the gods’ needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open-air courtyard, and an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, pyramidal towers, often called "Golden Letter Form God Towers," are built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for deities.
Due to the warm climate in the Middle East, houses become less important.
Most Hebrew families conducted their daily life outdoors.
Women were cooking in the backyard; the shops were simply open-fronted stalls facing the street. Stones were used for building houses.
Due to Canaan’s territory lacking large forests, timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter, and discovered the island while sailing west, naming it Greenland.
No matter what his discoveries were, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although every country once was a "Scandinavia," there are still many differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie *National Treasure*, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the *Declaration of Independence*.
But that wasn't the case. Although there was some writing on the back of the document, it wasn't a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written “Original Declaration of Independence July 4th 1776.” This text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored rolled up.
Therefore, adding symbols was likely just for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the “Vichy” French. This group of French people made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces landed in Southern France, and this offensive was called “Operation Dragoon.”
American and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks, then turned towards Germany.
Civilization refers to a single culture shared by a large group of people (i.e., a society) living and working together cooperatively.
The term "civilization" originates from the Latin word *civilis* (meaning civic), which is related to *civis* (meaning citizen) and *civitas* (meaning city or city-state) in Latin – and to some extent, this also defines the scale of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture signifies the transmission of knowledge across numerous generations, the continuation of cultural legacies, and a certain degree of dissemination.
The cultures of minority groups often disappear without leaving behind related historical evidence, and thus are unable to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (consisting of only Congress as its sole component).
The legislature lacked any power to levy taxes. Moreover, as the national executive or judicial branches did not yet exist, the legislature could only rely on the state governments – often uncooperative – to enforce all laws.
The Congress also has no power to overturn the tax laws and tariffs between individual states.
The regulations require unanimous consent from all states to be amended, but these states don't prioritize the central government, and even their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are tied for second in the world, and they were also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include: football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians also participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan possesses nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan possessing a group of islands, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan’s history can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or “Beautiful Island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, began reforming the indigenous grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers in its rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) military forces took control of western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was officially declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Maguan (Shimonoseki Treaty). This treaty ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japanese rule over the island lasted until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the perimeter of this architectural complex have been reconstructed, allowing visitors to better understand their original appearance.
Up until 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common still photography format in the world, and it was also the most widely used size at the end of the analog film photography era.
Although production continues to this day, more importantly, the aspect ratio was also adopted for the image sensors of subsequent digital cameras.
The name "35mm format" is a bit misleading, as it's actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This aspect ratio (dividing by twelve gives the simplest whole number ratio) can therefore be expressed as three to two.
Many common formats (such as those used in advanced photography systems) also share this aspect ratio or differ from it.
The rule of thirds, often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that allows for a dynamic feel while still maintaining order in an image.
It points out that the most effective placement of the subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both horizontally and vertically (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church was subjected to strict scrutiny due to becoming wealthy and powerful.
For over a thousand years, despite some differences in language and customs, Christianity has kept the nations of Europe inextricably linked.
Its pervasive power influences everyone, whether king or commoner.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is why the church has funds.
The central authority of the Roman Catholic Church has a history of a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it aligns with its tenets.
Immediately following the outbreak of war, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved effective in cutting off essential military and civilian supplies, but this blockade violated international law established by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK is deploying forces in international waters, preventing any vessels from entering the entire maritime area, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this strategy, Germany anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, most citizens and countries generally adhered to pacifism and isolationism.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations hoped to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and began working at Edison's company located in New York City.
He arrived in America with four cents in savings, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Batcheller, his former manager.
In ancient times, China had a unique way of marking different periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were periods of instability with fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles engaged in fierce wars while vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands of people perishing in the struggle to ascend to the highest throne in the Great Imperial Palace of Xi'an.
Numerous social and political influences emerged one after another, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the state belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Additionally, after the revolution, all professions were opened to applications from all men, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals to inherit them.
The military faces the same situation, as military rank is no longer tied to social class, but determined by ability.
The French Revolution simultaneously awakened the numerous oppressed working-class masses in other countries, initiating their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He often went to a cave named Hira on Mount Noor (meaning "light") to meditate.
The cave, weathered by time, provided a distinct spiritual image of Muhammad.
Resting on the mountaintop of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is secluded from the world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it’s difficult to find. When you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Here, you'll only see the clear, beautiful sky and the embracing mountains. Looking out from the cave, you only see and hear a small piece of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of many large pyramids used as monuments to deceased pharaohs.
Located in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, the Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) features several pyramids – the Great Pyramid being the largest – along with numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate the Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate his wives and family members.
The “rising tone” marker looks like a V-shape, while the “falling tone” marker looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
The meaning of “向上” (seung hoeng) is that you should push the bow from the top, while the meaning of “向下” (seung haa) is that you should pull the bow from the root of the bow (where you hold the bow).
When drawing the bow, the sound is typically softer, while releasing it produces a stronger, more solid sound.
Feel free to write down your own markings, but remember that printed bow markings all have musical reasons, so generally speaking, they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from the Palace of Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd who were angrily roaring and loudly threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage.
A rogue suddenly brandished the head of a royal guard, beheaded at the Palace of Versailles, before the terrified queen.
American imperialism conquered the Philippines, and the costs of the war were ultimately borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, with most expenditures and bond interest paid through Wall Street banks under the guise of the Philippine government.
Of course, the surplus value generated by the long-exploited Filipino people will form the basic income of American imperialism.
Before understanding the Knights Templar, we must understand the historical context that led to their founding.
The time period in which the event occurred is often considered the High Middle Ages in European history, namely the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages; it is generally believed that the Late Middle Ages ended around 1500 AD.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a variety of ideas being practiced, ranging from technology pushing or technological imperative, to, in a strict sense, the belief that human destiny is driven by the deep logic associated with scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common viewpoints: that the development trajectory of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, has an inherent “impact” on society rather than being constrained by it.
For example, someone might say that the automobile inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, if there were only a small number of cars, a nationwide road network would not be economically feasible, therefore new production methods would be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Having a large number of cars also leads to more road accidents, which in turn brings about new medical technological inventions to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Against the backdrop of Romanticism, the geographical environment shapes the individual, and customs and cultures associated with that environment emerge over time. These cultural practices align with the social order rather than being arbitrarily imposed by law.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion metropolis of Europe during the feudal period.
From around 400 AD, it was known as a center for luxury goods, and remained so until approximately 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its importance gradually declined, mainly because the Crusades brought back spoils of war such as silk and spices, which were more popular than the goods offered in the Byzantine market.
From this time onward, the title of fashion capital was surrendered by Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak popularity in the 10th to 11th centuries, and again in the 14th century.
The initial dress designs were heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication between the east and west, fashion trends in the west lagged behind those in the east by 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style of dress. The most significant development at the time came from the Crusades, which led people to start using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Sustainable agriculture advocates producing only enough food to feed farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that utilizes locally preserved seeds from the eco-region, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together a group of like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms, and these subcultures allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The distinctiveness of subcultures can stem from the age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of their members.
The defining characteristics of a subculture can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexual orientation, geography, or a combination of different factors.
Members of subcultures typically express their identity through distinctive and symbolic means, including clothing, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during their development, did not receive proper social conditioning from adults.
These children are generally referred to as “feral children.” Some feral children have been confined (usually by their parents), while other cases involve abandonment due to parents refusing to accept their child’s severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children who are abandoned or run away may have previously experienced severe abuse or trauma.
Some people are said to have been raised by animals, while others survived on their own in the wilderness.
When feral children are raised by non-human animals, their exhibited behaviors (within the limits of their physical capabilities) closely resemble those of the animal that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Focused learning on this topic will make learning easier and more enjoyable, while scaffolding theory takes it a step further.
Scaffolding theory isn’t a learning method, but rather a support system assisting people experiencing a new learning process, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual, or it can be real; in other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffolding, and even the little paperclip guy in Microsoft Office can be a form of it too.
Scaffolding is internalized within the software, designed to prompt, stimulate, and explain procedures that students find difficult to handle independently.
There are many reasons why a child might be placed in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, affection, and education, yet these children are experiencing all of this.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide them with everything they lacked in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The obvious characteristic of the internet has broadened the scope of its use and the ways in which it satisfies needs.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” were considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivations when studying user responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in interpreting fleeting microexpressions and facial movements.
Specifically, it is said that accurately interpreting microexpressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks points out in his essay "The President's Speech" that even people who cannot understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge the speaker's sincerity.
He even suggested that domestic animals, like dogs, might possess the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that genetic variations are divided into two types: recessive and dominant.
The mutation increased new genetic variations and selectively removed dominant variations from the gene pool.
Separation and recombination alternate back and forth within the two gene pools of each generation.
On the savanna, primates (with digestive systems similar to humans) struggle to obtain the necessary amino acids from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure can bring about serious consequences: stunted development, malnutrition, and even ultimately lead to death.
The most readily available plant resource is protein obtained from leafy or legume plants, but this protein is difficult for primates like us to digest if these plants are not cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, it’s not surprising that our ancestors solved the “protein problem” in a similar way to how chimpanzees in today’s savannas do.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep within a short period of time (ten to sixty minutes).
Simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock that gently awakens you without fully rousing you can easily achieve this.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm based choices include drinking large amounts of fluids before bed (especially known diuretics like water or tea), forcing oneself to wake up to urinate.
The inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the physical and mental tension they experience.
The less stressed you are, the more positive the life force you express will be. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of enlightenment. The only thing hindering progress towards this goal is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is founded on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was spread through the compassion of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques originating from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is fundamentally very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to great compassion.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (energy of awakening) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The central practice of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing various deities, one purifies energy channels, opens chakras, and generates a consciousness of awakening.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, prompting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, with the war’s end, conflicts in systems, processes, and culture led to discord between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War officially began.
It will continue for the next forty years and will be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been broken, and its only hope was to withdraw along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army violated the Treaty of Riga – the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact – as well as other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, invading eastern Poland and establishing fronts in Belarus and Ukraine.
Utilizing shipping is currently the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The navy's traditional responsibility is to ensure your country has the ability to transport its citizens and goods, while simultaneously disrupting your enemy's ability to transport theirs.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to cross the Atlantic, transporting personnel and supplies to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy mainly used U-boats to try to disrupt shipping.
If the Allied forces were to fail, Germany might be able to conquer Britain, just as it had conquered other European countries before.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Goats are typically herded and grazed in mountainous or grassy areas, tended to by shepherds who are usually children or adolescents, similar to the shepherds we are more familiar with. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built carriage roads as early as the 16th century.
Although carriage roads were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to travel faster and pull heavier loads compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
The use of wooden sleepers to secure the rails was introduced very early on. However, gradually, people discovered that adding a small amount of iron to the rail surface was more effective.
This evolved into a common practice, but iron would cause greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of carts.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, with the first all-iron railway being introduced in 1767.
It is known that the earliest form of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of *Homo erectus* (meaning upright man), humans began to walk upright two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the southern ancient apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Fossil discoveries of *Australopithecus* dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago show specialized features for bipedalism, but *Sahelanthropus tchadensis* may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can participate in environmental movements, and even become active advocates, reducing harm to the future to some extent.
This is like treating the symptoms rather than the disease in many situations. However, if we don’t just want a temporary fix, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it at the source.
Clearly, as human technology and techniques advance by leaps and bounds, the world has been completely transformed. Due to overpopulation and humanity’s excessively lavish lifestyles, the problems have become even more severe.
After Congress passed the bill on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was subsequently sent to the John Dunlap printing shop, several blocks away.
Having made 150 to 200 copies overnight, it is now known as the "Dunlop single-sided print."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in the front yard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was mailed to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy was sent to London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlop single-sided proofs are the oldest extant versions of the document; the original manuscript no longer exists.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived to this day. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
However, there are still many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rexes.
Currently, all computers in use are almost entirely based on the manipulation of information, and this information is encoded in the form of binary digits.
Binary digits can only exist as one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are referred to as binary numbers or bits in computer terminology.
Visceral poisoning may not manifest immediately. Symptoms like vomiting are very common and don’t allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning could be the presence of opened medicine containers or toxic household chemicals left at the scene.
Check the label of a specific poison to obtain the designated first aid instructions.
The term "insect" used by entomologists, in a formal sense, refers to this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are particularly well-adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nest-dwelling animals, habitually living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might consider raising a baby not to be in their best interests, or not in the child's best interests.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the biological parents terminate their parental rights to allow another couple to become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this method indeed guides the majority of scientific research.
Conducting experiments isn't the only method; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more plausible hypotheses, while questioning and observation can equally lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science (including psychology) are widely recognized.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the Western world severed its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral processes generally depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through physiological clocks.
Periodic rhythms are not only responses to external periodic cues, but are also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The circadian rhythm is self-sustaining and oscillates even without external cues, continuing to run freely for a period of time.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the important proposals demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one marking the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus, and the other marking the proteins in bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of variation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, variations can have a wide range of effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while other mutations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature allows appreciation of scenery, including wildlife and plants, and has a great appeal for nature lovers.
On-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and researching information about ecosystems.
One example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to their workplaces, passing by those whose destination is precisely the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected to and supports the transportation system to some extent with their private vehicles.
Current science indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has shifted the biosphere out of one of its stable states – a state that has underpinned human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about it.
You rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses to a similar extent in developed countries.
Why does the transportation system lead to these complaints? Why does it break down every day? Are the transportation engineers so incompetent? Or is it because there are some more fundamental problems?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow research isn't easy, because we can't predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior tends to fall within a reasonable and stable range; therefore, traffic flow tends to exhibit a certain degree of rational consistency and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationship between three key characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the earliest animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helps them evade enemies more easily, while also allowing them to find food and mates more effectively.
The majority of insects benefit from having wings that fold back along their bodies.
This allows them to reach more small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus of Samos said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many believe the opposite – that the solar system (including the sun, and even other celestial bodies) revolves around the Earth.
It seems reasonable, after all, it doesn't *feel* like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world’s second longest and largest river. Its water discharge is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from rivers to the ocean on Earth comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River’s main channel is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the practice of building pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and sophisticated construction techniques of the Great Pyramid of Giza have never been surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments left behind by the previous period, which had a history of over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest country in the world in both area and population.
The laws and official communication language of Vatican City are Italian.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people working in that country, while Latin is more commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens within Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory stating that all things are composed of one or more mixtures of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. But his theory also posits that different forms of these elements transform into new substances, creating what we see around us.
Alloys are basically mixtures composed of two or more metals. Don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium and potassium, among other elements, are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals as well, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is composed of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
Therefore, when pencils were first introduced, many people considered them good friends.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and frequency of use of pencils have declined.
People now type messages on computer screens and no longer need pencil sharpeners.
People can only curiously wonder what will happen to the keyboard when new things appear.
The operating principle of a fission bomb is that energy is required to combine nuclei with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then split the nucleus again and release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate even with only slight vibrations or no vibrations at all.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the front side and 100 kilometers thick on the back side.
Under the lunar maria, the crust is thinner; under the highlands, it is thicker.
Due to the thinner crust, the near side likely has more maria (lunar seas), allowing magma to rise to the surface more easily.
The content theory focuses on finding out the reasons why people do certain things or what causes their interest.
These theories propose that as people mature into adults, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theories explore what drives some people to desire to do certain things, and what factors in their environment lead them to do or not do those things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager begins to lead former peers, two types of behaviors can emerge. At one end of the spectrum is attempting to remain “one of them.”
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning job responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is the manager transforming into a completely different person, one who believes everything constant within the team must be changed and that they must take full responsibility for it all.
After all, a leader must ultimately be responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior can sometimes lead to disagreements between the leader and the other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same high standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are still slight differences between the two.
The function of virtual team members is typically to serve as the point of contact with their direct, physical teams.
Because their team can meet across different time zones, and local management may not fully understand this, they often have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The actual existence of “invisible teams” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component within virtual teams.
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports, and which sets standards for each member."
Why are organizations willing to invest time in becoming learning organizations? One goal of implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources and functional departments within an organization are fully utilized, creativity and originality will be elevated.
Ultimately, the process of internal collaboration within an organization to overcome challenges can lead to innovative processes for meeting customer needs.
Before institutional reform, leaders must establish a culture of innovation, as well as promote knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained that continuous improvement is a method used to help organizations enhance their performance.
Data from neurobiology provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches of cognitive research, thereby narrowing its scope and making it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior has been confirmed by scientists' research.
Long ago, people already knew that different types of brain injuries, trauma, damage, and tumors could all affect behavior and lead to changes in some psychological functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and operational processes never seen before.
This provides a lot of information and materials, allowing us to build a simulated model to help us understand how the brain works.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong association with science fiction, it remains a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
The study of artificial intelligence involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior by machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and facial recognition.
The aforementioned areas have now each become independent fields, focused on providing solutions to problems encountered in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have also been implemented in software applications for some home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of all teaching; teachers often want to take students to places buses can’t directly reach for these excursions.
Technology offers virtual field trip solutions. Students can comfortably visit museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork from the comfort of their classrooms.
Virtual field trips are also a good way to reflect on and share experiences from field studies in future teaching.
For example, students at Bennett College in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but older versions are also preserved online as keepsakes.
Blogging can also improve students’ writing skills. Students often make significant errors in grammar and spelling when they first start blogging, but the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Because students are typically the most discerning audience, bloggers will start to work on improving their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, the blog “Enhancing Students’ Understanding of Their Surroundings” satisfies readers’ interests and inspires students to become smarter and more engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool for inspiring student collaboration and encouraging students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can enhance students’ analytical abilities and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own positions based on the meaning of others’ writing and outline their views on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital, featuring a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, while to the north are undeveloped natural landscapes such as the Muskoka River.
All of this further highlights Ontario and is widely considered a typical Canadian place.
Most of the northern areas are sparsely populated, and some are even uninhabited wildernesses.
This is a surprising demographic comparison: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island continent and a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are also known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land and carried out large-scale occupations in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism originated in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
The northern area is surrounded by the Sahara, while the south and west are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For any female traveler, regardless of marital status, it is advisable to say she is married.
Bringing a ring might be helpful (just don't let it look too expensive).
Women should understand that certain cultural differences can lead to incidents perceived as harassment, such as being followed or having one's arm grabbed, which are quite common.
When rejecting a man, you must be firm; don't be afraid to express your stance (cultural differences are not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, then known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name of the House of Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badiyah, where Spanish merchants established a trading base and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
It’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods near Old Macao, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of knick-knacks, but they all cater to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located on the easternmost side, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. Volcanic lava inundated most of the town’s streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and offers the most affordable gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda motorcycle taxi to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
Adding to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for a faraway, exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its historical reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to the encroachment of desert winds and sandstorms, this site was listed as a World Heritage Site in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special *Wonder of the African World* identified this location as one of its key stops.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has a more Arab flavor when compared to African cities.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen different ecological zones, each providing habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the flagship park within the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
If you buy a Wild Card, there are benefits – it allows you entry into designated South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong, and is also a focal point for many tourists.
The numerous skyscrapers that make up Hong Kong’s skyline are like a shimmering bar chart, appearing particularly dazzling against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
If you want to appreciate the most beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to the Kowloon waterfront across the harbor.
Most of the urban development in Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land along the north shore.
This place was once occupied by British colonists, and is a good starting point for finding evidence of colonial history on this territory.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest located within India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests here are not only mangrove swamps, but also among the last remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The area of Sudan is 3,850 square kilometers, about one-third of which is water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that the area is currently home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run 24/7 from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river), but most departures are concentrated between 6:30 and 7:30 AM (especially those heading east and to Jaca/Boomtang).
Due to intercity buses often being full, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses for convenient and stable transport.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque with the French Guianan city of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock.
The twin towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. It was completed in August 2011, but didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, coinciding with the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guarani people inhabit present-day eastern Paraguay and are the largest indigenous group in the area. They live a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua. They lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Giant Indians," came into being through the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the local indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has consistently succeeded in preserving many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is renowned for possessing one of the world’s best polo teams and players.
The year's biggest championship tournament will be held at the Las Cañitas polo field in December.
The rest of the year also offers opportunities to watch smaller tournaments and competitions.
For information regarding the competition and where to purchase tickets for the polo match, please refer to the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with its value set to be equivalent to one pound sterling (GBP).
Currency can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located opposite the Stanley FIC West shop.
Pound Sterling is accepted anywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted.
On outlying islands, credit cards are generally not accepted, but British and American currency may be; you should confirm acceptable payment methods with the shop owner in advance.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it experiences summer during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winters can be deceptive—temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There isn't a distinct "rainy season" or "dry season" there: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to seeing humans, these wild animals still retain their wild instincts and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance from them.
Additionally, please be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and Britain all refused to leave the harbor.
Except for a British cruiser, all the ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence within the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in town led to the death of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches in this area. The most popular beaches are all located within three areas.
North Shore Beach (North Port District) is located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Here, almost all the beaches are suitable for swimming, and most are planted with pohutukawa trees, providing shade.
Takapuna Beach is in Waitematā Harbour, located between Mission Bay in central Auckland and the upscale suburb of St Heliers.
This place is popular with families who come to swim, so it can get crowded sometimes, and there are many shops along the shore. Swimming here is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One.” It’s not a complex beer, but it feels pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta.”
Here you can buy a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be easier to ship.
The local tap water is very safe to drink. However, if you're worried, bottled water is also readily available.
For Australians, “white” coffee is a foreign concept. Short black is “espresso”, foamed coffee has a generous amount of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the juice is expensive, the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many people visit the coral reefs for tourism. And on the coral reefs, injuries due to any of the aforementioned reasons are quite rare.
Even so, you should still follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October 1770 to April, box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths. Outside of this period, they can occasionally be found as well.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away on their own.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to have accommodation upon arrival at their destination, providing a sense of security.
Travel agencies usually have partnerships with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation such as campsites through them.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, round-trip airport transfers, and even combinations of flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the quote or obtain other documents for the destination (such as a visa), they can also hold the booking for you.
Any modifications or requests should be made through the travel agency, not directly with the hotel.
At many music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on-site, and they consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to get close to the event location, you should arrive earlier and find a campsite near the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage may have ended, some parts of the music festival might still be playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If you're traveling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the location of your cabin, as cabins most affected when passing through icy waters can experience very frightening noises.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city, and cruise passengers may be exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions for details).
Casinos typically try their best to make guests spend the most time and money; they usually have no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment arrangements to keep guests in good spirits and staying in the casino.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, traction is reduced, and you cannot drive in the same way as on ordinary asphalt roads.
In a blizzard, snowfall within a very short period can be enough to trap you.
Visibility may be restricted due to snowfall, blizzard conditions, or condensation/ice forming on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, freezing rain and snowfall are common in many countries, and traffic is rarely disrupted throughout the year.
Hunting trips are perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa, and are also the itinerary many travelers look forward to the most.
The term "safari" generally refers to observing stunning African wildlife by land, especially on the savanna.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) like to approach vehicles, and standard equipment allows you to see them clearly.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards can be shy, and it’s easier to spot them with binoculars.
Backcountry hunting trips (also known as “jungle walks,” “hunting hikes,” or “walking safaris”) involve hikes that can last for hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other areas within Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the last time being in 1964.
If you had already booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not cover events scheduled after July 2020 (the originally scheduled time for the Olympics).
The expected price range for most event tickets is between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels can lend out irons and ironing boards even if they aren’t in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then if you have a hair dryer, you can try using that.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, it will scorch).
There are many different methods for water purification on the market, and some are effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it requires several minutes.
The effectiveness of water filters varies; if you have concerns, you might consider purchasing sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animals and insects that are uncommon in their hometown.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing people with force, generally do not meet the criteria to be considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to purchasing tax-exempt goods at designated locations.
Travelers can sometimes save a significant amount of money in countries with high taxes, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of Buffalo–Pittsburgh Highway between Marion Point and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving environment, frequently running through remote and secluded terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: here there are mainly steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The legal speed limit is noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections, typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and adhering to the speed limit is more important than anything else.
However, strangely enough, the cell service signal here is much stronger than in many other stretches along the way, for example, in the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are delicious, and those from Bavaria are similar to the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria, with a very rich and diverse range of styles.
Fruit pastries are very common, and you can find apple-based pastries all year round, while cherries and plums are regulars in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A popular cake paired with a cup of rich coffee is usually an excellent combination.
If you want to try some small and delicious pastries, you can try Berliner jam-filled doughnuts, which are also known as Berliners, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish primarily made with herbs and spices, and served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be “dry” or “wet,” depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and inland Pakistan, cheese is a common ingredient in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, without further qualifiers, the term tends to be interpreted as referring to food originating from the central and eastern parts of Java Island.
Currently, Javanese cuisine is found everywhere in the archipelago, encompassing a range of simply seasoned dishes, with peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices being the primary seasonings favored by Javanese people.
Stirrups are supports for the feet hung on either side of a saddle by a rider.
They provide jockeys with greater stability, but also pose a safety risk as a jockey’s feet could get stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, and the horse runs off, they could be dragged. To minimize this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders' boots have heels and smooth, fairly narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles (particularly English saddles) are equipped with safety bars, allowing jockeys to pull back when falling, which causes the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle.
Chile's top climbing destination – Cochamó Valley, also known as the Yosemite Valley of South America – boasts diverse, massive granite walls and cliffs.
The scenery of the mountain peaks is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world continuously develop new routes along the endless rocky cliffs in the valley.
Downhill skiing (including skiing and snowboarding) is popular, and involves attaching skis or a snowboard to your feet and sliding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity, and it has many enthusiasts (sometimes referred to as “ski fanatics”) who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring (also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking) is an activity defined as such.
While often associated with high-alpine ski touring or mountaineering, most of it doesn't involve those activities. The latter are done on steep slopes and require harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski run as similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, your skiing range can be further than walking distance. But in very rare cases, you can have the speed of cross-country skiing without needing to carry a heavy backpack and glide along groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Generally, traveling to multiple countries means needing to apply for visas multiple times and go through passport control multiple times.
However, the Shengen area operates in this regard like a country.
As long as you remain within the Shengen area, you generally do not need to go through passport control when crossing borders.
Similarly, with a Divine Root Visa, you do not need to apply for visas from each Divine Root member country individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a unified definition for what manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define items with a history of over a hundred years as antiques.
This definition varies by region; the age restrictions for antiques in places like North America may be shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than mass-produced items of the same type.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture of reindeer trade is also important to many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they relied on fishing, hunting, and similar activities for survival, with reindeer mainly used as draft animals for pulling vehicles.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used (especially by non-Roma people), it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting has a travel alert issued for it, your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
In addition to referring to the advice of your own national government, you can also refer to the advice of other national governments, but their advice is often designed for their own citizens.
To illustrate, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories are merely a simplified overview of a country’s political situation.
Compared to more detailed information available elsewhere, the suggestions presented here are rather rough, general, and overly concise.
Severe weather is a general term referring to any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and comes in different types, which may depend on the geography, terrain, and atmospheric environment.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and impacts of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms, among others.
Strongly advise travelers to be aware of the risks brought by severe weather that may affect their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone must undergo professional training beforehand.
Searching the internet for "hostile environment awareness training" may provide the addresses of local companies.
A typical course will cover all the topics discussed here, with detailed analysis, and usually includes practical experience.
A typical course lasts between 2-5 days, and includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and some weapons training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are very common, but those mentioning war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning to undergo gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents needed for their return trip.
Government policies vary internationally regarding passports issued or updated without a clearly stated gender (X) and documents to align with desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to implement these documents also falls far short.
After September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints also became more intrusive.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity when going through scanners.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves impacting the beach, and typically occur near reefs or similar formations.
Due to underwater topographic backflow being concentrated in some deeper sections, rapid currents in deep water originate from there.
Most fatalities are due to exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current, a maneuver that is unlikely to succeed.
Once you break free from the current, swimming back is as easy as usual.
When you haven't been found yet, try aiming for somewhere else, but this also depends on your ability and whether you've been noticed, as you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entering the workforce hits faster than culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon period). It lasts longer and can potentially be more severe.
Travelers who once easily adapted to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their own culture.
After living abroad and returning home, you've adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits you had in your native culture.
When you first go abroad, people may offer patience and understanding, because they know that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People might not realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
For the children, the pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can admire the pyramids in the darkness, and observe them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and hawkers. The stories of sounds and lights are like a storybook.
The sphinx was established as the backdrop and narrator for a lengthy story.
Display a scene on the pyramids, with different pyramids lit up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are currently subject to sovereignty claims by several nations, and have the highest number of bases on them – a total of 16 operating bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is home to the town of Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where an active volcanic crater is flooded to form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, then the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains emerge, and are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The north face or Sentinel Ridge boasts the highest mountain range in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with its peak at Mount Vinson, standing at 4892 meters.
In remote areas with no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
Satellite phones generally cannot replace mobile phones, as you must be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
This type of service is frequently used in shipping, including yachts, and expeditions requiring long-distance data and voice communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a gap year, traveling and studying is an increasingly popular choice.
This is particularly popular among secondary school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without negatively impacting their education.
In many cases, studying a gap year program abroad can actually increase your chances of being accepted into higher education in your home country.
Generally speaking, tuition fees are required to attend these educational courses.
Finland is perfect for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands in both its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
Yachts are not essential for touring archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are spacious enough to accommodate any yacht, smaller vessels, even rowboats, can offer a uniquely different experience.
Boating is a very common leisure activity for Finns, with roughly one boat for every seven or eight people.
Similar situations exist in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but Finland is particularly unique compared to other countries (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the unique Baltic cruise ships stay in St. Petersburg, Russia for a longer period of time.
This means you’ll have a full two days to visit this historic city, and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
As of 2009, if you only arrive by boat for tourism, you will not need an additional visa.
Some cruise brochures feature German Berlin. As seen on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and the cost of visiting the city is not included in the cruise price.
For people of any age and background, flying can be a frightening experience, especially if they haven't flown before or have previously experienced a traumatic event.
This isn't something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions many people experience.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies receive generous compensation for their rapid delivery of items. For business documents, merchandise, or urgent repair parts, time is often of the essence.
On some routes, large companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies have problems.
If they transport goods by plane, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The quickest way is to check it in as baggage. Airlines have regulations against transporting baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy that privilege (a better way is to have your company pay for it).
However, it’s not cheap: based on rough experience, you can expect business class tickets to be around four times the price of a regular economy ticket, and first class tickets to be eleven times as much!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to look for deals on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Because airlines are well aware that some core business travelers are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered greatly from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the emergence of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, a republic with its own government and currency, but without recognition from any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir, Turkey's third-largest city, has a population of approximately 3.7 million and is the second-largest port after Istanbul, also serving as a major transportation hub.
The former city of Siam, now is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, surrounded by a vast bay and mountains.
Wide, tree-lined avenues, buildings with glass facades, modern shopping centers alongside traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches dot the city, but it has a more Mediterranean European feel than a traditional Turkish one.
From the village of Haldorsvik, you can see the nearby island of Austevoll, and the village also has a unique octagonal church.
In the church cemetery, some of the graves are adorned with interesting marble dove sculptures.
This charming village is worth spending half an hour wandering around.
The romantic and charming town of Sintra, not far to the north, is world-renowned thanks to Lord Byron’s glowing descriptions of it.
Scotturb bus number 403 regularly runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Visiting the Great Chapel of Our Lady of Sheshan (the Sanctuary) in the north is a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember, you are not just visiting a mass grave, this place is also a site of immense significance to many people around the world.
Here, many people still survived, while even more Jews and non-Jews had family members who were murdered or worked to death.
Please treat this place with the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Never joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the venue, or write or deface buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand Catalan, and virtually everyone understands Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as Catalan is the legally mandated first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used on public transport and other facilities.
The regular announcements on the subway are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions will be announced in multiple languages by the automated system, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to interact with people in Paris is still to present your best self, as if you were a person with “bien élevé” (good upbringing/manners). This will make your visit much easier.
If you show some basic politeness, the Parisians’ rude exterior will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park boasts dense forests primarily composed of beech, spruce, and fir trees, along with a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its possession of a series of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, it clearly boasts a particularly diverse range of plant communities.
This region is also home to a great variety of animals and birds.
Here you can discover rare animal populations, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and capercaillie, as well as many common species.
When visiting the monastery, ladies are required to wear skirts that cover the knees, and shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries will provide scarves for ladies who aren’t prepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, the monks or nuns at the entrance will greet you with a smile.
At the same time, gentlemen must wear knee-length pants.
These are also available to borrow from the inventory at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after every use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to that of other Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and everything is prepared with olive oil.
Pa amb Oli is a simple, popular summer dinner: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns used with “Sie” must begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing between verbs and objects.
One could also say it’s easier to read this way, even though the writing is a bit complex, as it requires figuring out whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easier because most words are pronounced as they are written.
Pay attention to the two main letters, 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciations change depending on the following vowel.
Also, it’s important to ensure the pronunciations of ‘r’ and ‘rr’ are distinct: ‘caro’ means ‘dear,’ while ‘carro’ represents a two-wheeled carriage.
Persian grammar is relatively simple and largely regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar introductory book can help you learn more Persian grammar and fully understand sentences.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, then learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, someone who only knows a little Spanish might carelessly conclude that it's unnecessary to study Portuguese separately, despite how similar the two languages are.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually abandoned and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't as severe during their heyday as it is now, they were typically located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as *hanami*, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where people choose to appreciate plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties (sakura parties) were held near the Imperial Palace, hosted by the Emperor for himself and other imperial nobles.
Plants are beautiful only when they grow in a natural environment, therefore you must resist the temptation to take even “just a little” as a specimen.
If you visit the meticulously arranged garden and collect “specimens,” you will definitely be expelled – there’s no room for discussion.
Singapore is usually a very safe place, and it’s very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
However, Singapore is located in the "high tropics" – a few degrees north of the equator – and you need to get used to (frequently) very hot weather and intense sun (which you encounter less often when the weather is cloudy).
There are still several buses heading north to Hebron, which is the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Please make sure the bus you board is headed to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Al-Arub.
Inland waterways might be a good theme for a vacation.
For example, exploring the castles of the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, or taking a boat trip to visit the charming towns along the Danube, or even canoeing around the Ille Canal.

Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity, and its purpose is to celebrate the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There's a tradition of waking up at some point on Easter night to watch the sunrise.
Of course, Christian theology can explain the origins of this tradition, but it was very likely a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches typically hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, with the congregation often entering into celebration abruptly when the midnight bells chime, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially came to the island arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the islands’ distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the long journey, which made giant tortoises the primary grazers of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galápagos Islands, they brought many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This offers a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be in complete darkness for 24 hours.
Due to the sparse population in these areas, light pollution is usually not a problem, and you can enjoy the stars.
Compared to the workplace culture commonly experienced by Westerners, the workplace culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by surname or job title.
Harmonious workplace relationships are extremely important, emphasizing collective team efforts rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors before making any decisions, and are expected to follow superiors' instructions without question.
