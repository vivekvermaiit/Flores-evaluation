USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than decertification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how such extensive abuse, as bravely described by the survivors of Larry Nassar, could have gone undetected for so long and supports all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor, and subsequently for the administration under Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carrot-colored underside.
The finding also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other characteristics of feathers – rays and barbules – researchers inferred that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The removal of structures suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or decoration. The researchers believed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chick down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the young dinosaur’s tail shows the plumage of an adult individual and not the down of a chick.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

They discovered that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with regard to magnetic flips.

The Iraqi study group presented the report at 12:00 PM today (GMT).
It warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, escalating violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins by calling for an open debate, and for consensus to be built in the US regarding the country's policy towards the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost all aspects of the government's current policy towards Iraq, and it calls for an immediate change of strategy.
As the first of 78 recommendations, it is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile interference and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal forces between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of masses of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.
Residents near the facility were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, turn off their air conditioning, and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, believes Dr. Moll, and at least two were hospital staff.
Within a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected people in South Africa at any given time.

Several million doses of encephalitis vaccines have also been promised by the government, which will help the healthcare system prepare for next year.
Plans for delivering vaccines to the areas historically hardest hit this year were delayed due to lack of funding and low prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where three years later he began working for the Swedish postal service and became their chief engraver.
He produced over 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.
His work is of such quality and detail that he is one of the very few “household names” among philatelists. Some specialize solely in collecting his work.
His 1,000th stamp was the magnificent "Great Deeds of Swedish Kings" by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl from 2000, which is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records.
He was also involved in the engraving of banknotes in many countries, recent examples of his work including portraits of prime ministers on the front of the new Canadian $5 and $100 bills.

All the cave entrances, which were named "The Seven Sisters", are between 100 and 250 meters (328 and 820 feet) in diameter.
Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations between night and day suggest they are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing from the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they don’t behave as stably as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech process: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper, indicating their choice of candidate, into an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is very precisely codified in French electoral law.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988, so voters and observers can see that the boxes do not contain any ballots at the start of the voting, and that no ballots are added other than those that have been correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates may send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and according to specific procedures.

In her second race, which was giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women’s seated category with a combined race time of 4:41.30 – 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place woman, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four skiers in the women's sitting class did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not rank in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is in pre-trial detention awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be flawed because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have considered the publication of images as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists need to be careful if they publish images of suspects etc."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be given, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both countries, as well as issues surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian Authority only accepts leaving the valley after five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control experiment were to be closely monitored by park rangers, as the experiment was supervised and its effect evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first cull operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
A new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP's departure was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures intended to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which hadn’t been held since 2011.
In approximately 60 reported cases, defective iPods have overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that they were aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 a.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported that there were no reports of damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
More hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took an elderly woman's place, as she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more so... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the survey share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the various extremes of the polling, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there has been doubt about his condition.
He couldn't take the medication needed to fight his pain, as it is prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, and particularly how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing marriage for same-sex couples.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
People are speculating whether he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on ground radars, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be put in place, and trains on the surface will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the surface.
The fear of missing transport raised the possibility that the match would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species developed in just two generations, despite previous beliefs that this process would have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin’s finch *Geospiza fortis* and the invasive cactus finch *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into very thin forms.
It can be drawn out into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color, depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Ions of hydrogen are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets connected to a sophisticated drainage system in almost all houses.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women gathered together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster modes of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are several medium-sized cats, who eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept, a specific task for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
The Huns are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides react much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly towards their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, capable of climbing (though not well), swimming, long jumping, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the loud bellow of a lion, but sounds more like a sequence of snarling, shouted words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and locate animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it previously needed to be.
The original population hasn't changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two population groups will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be powerless against it.
Even though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate a number of strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to have large banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They, for example, had neither corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests attempted to fulfill the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes they built pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women prepared the food in the courtyard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. The Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the American Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the note was simply attached as an addendum.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was governed by the French Vichy regime – a group of French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were beginning to focus on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of the society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization’s culture entails the transmission of knowledge across generations, lasting cultural influence, and just communication.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, they were dependent on state governments, which were often unwilling to enforce its actions.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous acceptance from all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government with such disregard that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the FIFA World Cup Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical perspective, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's history begins as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island named it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in the indigenous grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) take control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declare Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35mm, which was the most widespread film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, which can be confusing, actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also maintaining a certain order in a picture.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, came under closer scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European countries despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s financial resources are specifically used for this purpose.
The church's central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether its tenets were being properly upheld.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching their destination. This blockade was in violation of established international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations leaned towards pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were represented in a unique way; each Chinese time period, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, there was an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are a multitude of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Even after the revolution, professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, for instead of class-based ranking in the army, ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to begin their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave, known as "Hira," on Mount "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you're inside the cave, it's total isolation.
Only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many great pyramid structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-curve" mark looks like a V and the "down-curve" mark looks like a staple, or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes generally produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always add your own markings, but remember that the inscribed bowings are determined by musical reasons and should therefore usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming crowd shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the mafia presented the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, to the frightened queen.
The costs of war for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines was forced to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise funds for the majority of expenses, and bond interest flowed through the banks on Wall Street in the government's name.
Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that underpinned the founding of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas, practically from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that humanity's fate is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws, and the way they manifest in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an “impact” on society that is inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a country-wide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to heal bodily injuries.
Romanticism contained a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with the Romantic era, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to the geography, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It has been known as an epicenter of luxury since around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent during the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily inspired by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the eco-region, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abandonment, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
Such children are called “feral” or wild. Some feral children have been deprived of their liberty by people (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost identical to those of the animal that has cared for the child, such as its fears or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn something new – for example, how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and aims to question, request, and explain procedures that the student may have found too challenging to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care, and education, but unfortunately, they do.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that were lacking in the home from which the child was removed.
The internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to further dimensions regarding application and approaches to satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationship" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they researched audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in understanding microexpressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article, "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks indicated how people unable to understand speech due to brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets, such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the hidden and the visible.
New genetic variation is added through mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations through selection.
Separation and recombination shuffle the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Furthermore, there are serious consequences for non-compliance: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins existing in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest; it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn’t surprise us if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while still asleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which forces you to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is directly proportional to the amount of tension a person holds in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing standing in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana loving-kindness path and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center for Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, the differences in the countries' systems, processes, and cultures led to them opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was expected to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for freight transport is the most effective way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move its people and goods, while impacting your enemy's ability to move theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans attempted to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, roads for carts were built in England.
Even though the roadways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the somewhat more uneven roads of the time.
Sleepers were invented quite early on, to keep the rails in place. However, people gradually realised that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wagons' wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of metal were used.
The first known method of transportation was walking; people began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
There is evidence of bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap’s printing shop a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and on July 9th he had it read aloud to his soldiers in New York. An example reached London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest existing version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live on. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression originates from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in their host’s home or nest.
Across the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child to have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can assume them.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific investigations.
However, it doesn't stand alone – experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made within physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms, not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape as well as plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small villages by car to get to their workplaces, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a couple of million years, science now believes.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because drivers' behaviour cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. Their ability to fly helped them more easily evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith beetle and the mayfly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory – some believed he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the Earth spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth. It contains over 8 times as much water as the Earth’s second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is up to six miles (approximately 5.97 miles/9.6 km) wide in places.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Even though pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in the size of their constructions and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to excavate if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are fundamentally mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most people when it was first released.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to get close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the nucleus splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no prompting.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
It is thinner under the Maria and thicker under the Highlands.
There may be more lunar pits on the near side, as the crust is thinner here. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out what makes people react, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories investigate what it is about certain people that leads them to perform specific actions, and which elements in their surroundings cause them to carry out or refrain from carrying out those actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behavioral patterns can emerge when a manager begins to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of leader struggles to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary action, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
Despite everything, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are placed on virtual teams as on conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and inventiveness begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organization's functional departments.
As a result of this, the process within an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with, which can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI encompasses the ability to create machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, with a focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used within the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as it has been integrated into numerous home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often, a teacher would love to take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum objects, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a good method for evaluating a field trip and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and the website is rebuilt every year, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, “blogging forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active feedback on online materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written, as well as describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums exhibiting Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of these things, among others, highlight Ontario as what outsiders consider to be truly Canadian.
Further north, there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and the religion quickly spread throughout Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It’s sensible to wear something that looks like a wedding ring (it just shouldn’t look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port called Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of knick-knacks, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located far to the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Despite Goma being reasonably safe, any travel outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Together with the city's relative inaccessibility, this has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has a more Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and access fees to the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, as this either grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place many tourists consider the primary area of focus.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings that, with their reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong’s urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonizers made it their own, so if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km from the coast and into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not merely mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011. It did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group of indigenous people who lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also cultivated agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "the great province of the Indians," came into being in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the native populations.
The Spanish started the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world’s best polo teams as well as some of the world’s best players.
This year's biggest tournament will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can inquire with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West shop.
Overall, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the more remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are normal.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
There aren't particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and pretty much all large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Additionally, you should be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing smelly food, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for one British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering took place in the town that resulted in the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland, on the Waitemata Harbour.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the seafront. It is safe to swim here.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which isn't a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better to transport.
It is perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A “short black” is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in return, excellent.
Many visit the reef year-round, and people rarely get injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and follow advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be directed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you need to arrive early to get a tent pitch close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there may still be parts of the festival playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you're crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see the terms and conditions), which is good to know as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered on the house. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-slick roads, there is low friction, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally flows smoothly throughout the year.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what attracts the most tourists to Africa.
The term "safari" is often used to refer to land journeys to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the cars, and standard headlights are therefore sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that last either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may encounter problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not extend beyond July 2020, as the Olympics were scheduled to take place then.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there isn't one in the room.
If you don't have access to an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, while others require several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods in specific locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travellers heading to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often running through isolated terrain in the backcountry.
Be careful if you're not used to driving on country roads: there are plenty of steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The posted speed limits are remarkably lower than on stretches before and after—typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Strangely enough, the cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very flavorful and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand.
If you're in the mood for some small but rich pastries, you can try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a vast array of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
But if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a range of subtly spiced dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can pose safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse, but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, one can take certain safety precautions.
Firstly, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrups, which cause the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's largest climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America – has a range of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present absolutely breathtaking views from the summits to all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve gliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts – sometimes known as "ski bums" – who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years – cave paintings dating back as far as 5000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but doesn't usually involve downhill skiing or mountaineering. The latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should view the ski route as if it were a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to cover greater distances than if you walk – but it’s only very rarely that you’ll achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a journey through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
In this regard, however, the Schengen Area functions roughly as one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods that are over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding it is also important to many Sámi with other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami people kept large herds of reindeer, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and primarily used reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the word "sigøjner" is often used, especially among non-Roma people, it is frequently considered offensive due to the word’s association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel advisories are issued for the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It's also possible you want advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be tailored to their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The assessments are only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The expressed viewpoints are often with a superficial look at the matter, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious societal disruption, or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, blowing snow, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as it may impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the internet for "Hostile Environment Awareness Training" will likely give you the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with far more detail, typically with practical experience.
A course will typically last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there aren't many publications that deal with war zones.
Travellers planning gender affirming surgeries abroad should ensure they bring valid documentation for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with an unspecified gender (X), or documents that are updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Screening at security checkpoints has also become more intrusive in the period since September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar structure, is called a rip current.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, where a fast current to deep water can form.
Most fatalities occur as a result of exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you might be able to wait to be rescued.
Reverse culture shock comes faster than culture shock (there isn’t the same period of enthusiasm for the new), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes have a very hard time adapting to their own culture.
When you return home again, after having lived abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you travelled abroad for the first time, people were surely patient and understanding, as they knew that a traveler in a completely new country needs to adjust.
People don't necessarily expect travelers to show patience and understanding upon returning home.
The pyramid’s sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The island group lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet the high plateau and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range possesses Antarctica’s highest mountains, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas with no mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those leaving school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place on a higher education program in your home country.
There is typically a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic travel destination for sailors. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is a little reminiscent of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
On most Baltic cruises, an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia is offered.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days, returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before, or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no shame in it: it's no different than the fear and hatred towards other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Delivery companies charge a premium for fast delivery. Often, time is critical when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller businesses, there was a problem.
If they sent items via air freight, on some routes it could have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger. That’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a large pile of money on the table to get the opportunity (or even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy class price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no reason to even look for discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-declared Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third-largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very major transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling trading city located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are surrounded by traditional red-tiled roofs, the old 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some gravestones.
It’s worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within reach lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a laudatory account of its splendour by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, you can also visit the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), which is the site of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave. A place that has a crucial significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time there, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site with markings or by scratching graffiti onto the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan, as it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements on the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automated system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible – you should act as someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians’ cool exterior quickly evaporates if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forested areas – mainly beech and coniferous trees – and offers a blend of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, diverse soil types, and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here, alongside many more common species, one can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries have headscarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, and especially some with bright colors, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, it is required that men wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can be borrowed from the stockroom by the entrance, but the clothes aren’t washed after each use, so you might not be completely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and the use of a good deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any kind of available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word "you," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objectives.
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective has been used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means dear, while 'carro' means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
People who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it that one doesn't need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution wasn't such a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are generally found in cities or on campuses, where they are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Watching blossoming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where blossoms from plum trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you should resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be kicked out immediately without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally a very safe place to visit and very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you find yourself in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you need to deal with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also a few buses that run north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you are considering taking goes into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world have adopted many of the holiday traditions.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise from a prominent location.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, where congregations often break into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals couldn't make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first people arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
As there aren't many people living in these areas, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, and therefore emphasizes teamwork over praise of individual achievements.
Workers often need their superiors to approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
