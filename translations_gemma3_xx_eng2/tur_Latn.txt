This not only confirms the existence of feathers in at least some dinosaurs, which is already an established theory, but also provides details like color and three-dimensional structure that fossils generally cannot.
Scientists say this animal has pale or carotenoid-colored feathers on the underside of its body, and chestnut-brown feathers on the upper side.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Researchers concluded that the rachis – the central shaft of a feather – was likely a later evolutionary development, as dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rachis but possessed other feather-like characteristics such as barbs and barbules.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers say the sample exhibits adult feathers, despite being from a young dinosaur’s tail, indicating it’s not downy plumage.
Despite being thought to be the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers claim it indicated adult feathers, not chick down.
A bomb-laden vehicle that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, resulted in the deaths of two police officers and injuries to more than twenty people.

The work done was generally theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations targeting the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter, just like normal matter.
This theory posits that a large portion of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a manner similar to a luminous ring, and is composed of numerous small particles.

Voting in France is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters are left alone in a booth to place a pre-printed slip of paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the authorities verify the voter’s identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The French election law regulates procedures in a very strict manner.
Ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988. Thus, voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes inside the ballot boxes at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added to the boxes except for those cast by voters who have been properly counted and approved.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close scrutiny, following established procedures.

It was stated that the names of the defendants were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendant appeared in court with their face hidden.
When the car hit, there were three people at home, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
While the rescue team was extracting the driver from the red Audi TT, the road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed.
First, he/she was taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, who is accused of murdering his son, has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then.
He/She is awaiting indictment and trial while in custody, but the widespread official publication could compromise the reliability of evidence presented by eyewitnesses.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom. However, Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have found the publication of photographs potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from Dundee University says, "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they are publishing photos of suspects, etc."
The Royal Office, fully responsible for the prosecutions, announced that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is prepared.
The leaked document reportedly discusses the border dispute, stating that Palestine demands a return to the borders that existed before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Among the other topics covered were the issues of the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands the presence of soldiers in the valley for ten years following the signing of the agreement, while Palestine accepts this condition to be limited to five years.
It was planned that the hunters participating in the supplementary pesticide trial, while the trial was being observed and efficiency evaluated, would be closely monitored by the forest rangers.
Through a collaboration between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers joined the team under the Sporting Hunters Association’s hunting program.
According to Park Protection Acting Director Mick O'Flynn and NPWS Heritage, the four hunters selected for the initial culling operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly took the oath of office yesterday before the nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly’s fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended CEP’s resignation to push the country into a new election as part of a package of measures.
Martelly responded to the anti-government protests, which began in October and saw high participation, with this commission.
The inability to hold necessary elections sometimes paved the way for violent protests. Some have been pending since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPods have been reported to have overheated, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that they are aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 new overheating incidents and that the company considered these incidents to be “not serious.”
The Ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "truly regrettable" and responded accordingly.
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked buses in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire on tourists with an M16 rifle.
It has been confirmed that at least six people have lost their lives while a large number of hostages have been rescued.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released along with Filipino photographers.
Afterward, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She received her education in obstetrics and gynecology and began working at Auckland National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying premature birth in his spare time while working at the hospital.
Her research showed that applying hormones would accelerate fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestler's friends also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager, Luna, died on a night that was two months away. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as strange as I am... perhaps even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
According to a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, the number of Australians opposing a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that during the 2010 federal election campaign, she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extremes of the vote, 31% believe Australia should never become a republic, while 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness is in doubt due to complaints.
Because they were banned from competitions, he/she couldn't get the necessary medication to alleviate the pain.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
At the beginning of February, many people confirmed this discovery using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source that brought water to Earth along with organic materials capable of forming proteins and enabling life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed due to the collisions of comets with Earth a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his governorship at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old land-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No extra services will run, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities for cars on the surface will not be used.
The possibility increased that the match would be forced to be played behind closed doors, without the team's fans, due to fears about the lack of transportation.
A study published in the Science journal on Thursday reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that species evolved in as little as two generations. Previously, it was believed that this process took much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin’s finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and a migratory cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be put into any form and shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin, flexible cable. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations called "tezhip" in books.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical it contains is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons. This is because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron.
Mix two tablespoons of dry ingredients, then shape with clean, wet hands until it forms a ball.
The moisture in your hands reacting with the outer layers will give you a fun sensation and create a sort of crust on your skin.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of a sewage system were found in the houses of the Minoan cities located on Crete and Santorini Island in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Iran, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of bathhouses where men and women were together in a mixed-gender setting.
When you call someone who lives thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite as a means of communication.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite is being sent into space by a rocket. Because Earth's atmosphere breaks up some of our light and vision, scientists use telescopes in space.
A massive rocket taller than 30 meters is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel did for us was to provide much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath these, there are medium-sized cats that prey on average-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including released domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche – a special job that each cat possesses and prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of between one and three adult related males, along with around thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave much like packs of wolves or dogs—surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not other big cats)—and are also very deadly to their prey.
Being a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera). These four cats are the only cat species that can roar.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t resemble a lion’s full-throated roar, but rather sounds like a sentence constructed with much growling, shouting words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals an ocelot hunts are much smaller in size than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey (hunt) by sensing where other animals are and using their sense of smell.
They can see very well at night with night vision, and also move with extreme stealth. Ocelots capture their prey by blending into their environment.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the population they originated from (for example, if they go beyond a mountain range or river, or to a new island where returning would be difficult), they will generally find themselves in an environment different from their previous one.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, meaning the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they previously needed to be.
The original population hasn't changed at all. They still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look increasingly different from the original population.
Eventually, after thousands, even millions of years, these two animals will look so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (i.e., breathe out).
Plants obtain their nutrients through photosynthesis from the sun. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Animals could not survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws were filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row of teeth on the upper part of their mouths, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed their path.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and perhaps even members of its own species.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a massive dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for him.
Although we are familiar with many of the things they ate, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual banquet items, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and dormice – a type of rodent.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, rich men enjoyed reclining and feasting while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, considering that temple to be the god’s home.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would strive to meet the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house wasn’t all that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women made the meal in the garden; the shops were simply open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build the house.
In the land of Kenan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has a sparse population. Scandinavian sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Even if every country were 'Scandinavian', the people of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had many differences among their kings, traditions, and histories.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence Dated July 4, 1776." The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its life, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was wrapped for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the information will be added simply as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained under occupation.
Vichy was governed by the French. These were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, using the name "Operation Dragoon" for the invasion.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, that is, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning 'civil'. It is also related to the Latin word *civis*, meaning 'citizen', and the Latin word *civitas*, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and furthermore, it defines the scale of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilization represents the transmission of culture and knowledge across several generations, leaving a lasting cultural imprint and ensuring its just distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence about themselves and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially established a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress being the sole component of this government.
The congress lacked the power to tax and, with no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state officials who were often unwilling to cooperate in enforcing its actions.
They also lacked the authority to invalidate tax laws and interstate tariffs.
For amendments to be made, unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states underestimated the central government to such an extent that their representatives were often absent from their posts.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, alongside the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have around 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the collection/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is generally referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
Taiwan’s turning point dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a facility in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in local grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a territory of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would administer the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the facility have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, it takes its aspect ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
It's a bit confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
It is said that this format has an aspect ratio of 3:2 (found by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often overused and the subject of ridicule, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining balance in a photograph.
It states that the most effective area for the main subject is the intersection point of lines that divide the image into thirds both longitudinally and laterally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was brought under control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had held the states of Europe together despite differences in language and tradition.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the commoners.
One of the most important beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's capital is used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been located in Rome for over a thousand years. The concentration of power and money here led many to question whether this principle was being adhered to.
Immediately after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
Despite violating international law—which has been widely recognized as customary law in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries—the siege proved strategically effective and prevented the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies.
England created a danger even for neutral ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean.
Because a limited response was given to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolation.
Nations that witnessed the horror and cruelty brought by World War I wanted to avoid facing such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by (his former manager) Charles Batchelor.
Ancient China followed a unique path in demonstrating different time periods; each period of China, or each family in power, is a separate dynasty.
Additionally, a period of instability was experienced, consisting of regions divided among various dynasties. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars erupted among many nobles vying for the throne.
During the Three Kingdoms period, one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands perished fighting to reach the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Once again, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, ensuring that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same applies to the army, as army rankings are now based on Cailaber rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries to initiate their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life. He would frequently go to a cave on Mount Nur (Light), later named Hira, to immerse himself in contemplation.
The cave itself, remaining from those times, offers a very clear glimpse into Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave, located on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if its existence is known, finding it is not easy at all. Complete isolation prevails inside the cave.
Besides the clear, beautiful sky above us and the mountains in the vicinity, nothing can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is just one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many large pyramids constructed to honor deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, or the “Giza Necropolis,” includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several places of worship, and the Great Sphinx.
The magnificent pyramid was built to glorify Pharaoh Khufu, and much of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The up caret looks like a V, and the down caret looks like a staple or a square with its bottom side missing.
It means you need to start at the top limb and push the bow, while at the bottom you need to start from the grip (where you hold the bow) and draw the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more precise.
Feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed slurs are there for a musical reason, so you should generally follow them.
Terrified King Louis XVI, his two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), Queen Marie Antoinette, and the King’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forcibly exiled from Versailles to Paris by a large group of women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a group of people shouting at and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, someone from the crowd shook the head of a royal guard whose life was taken before the frightened Queen in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were being covered by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large portion of the interest and expenses on bonds issued through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Undoubtedly, the extra profit obtained through the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people is among the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the temple guardians, one must also understand the conditions that led to the formation of the cult.
The era in which these events took place is most often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period generally corresponding to the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, marking the end of the agreement.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a very broad range of ideas in practice. It includes views such as technological impetus or the inevitability of technology, which assert that, in essence, people’s fate is determined by a logic connected to scientific laws and the application of these laws in technology, often subconsciously.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has certain “effects” on societies which are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile spearheaded the development of roads as a necessity.
However, having a nationwide road infrastructure is not economically feasible if the number of vehicles is low. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the roads, which in turn drives the development of new techniques in the healthcare sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism possessed a broad cultural determinism characteristic of authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time traditions and cultures related to that geography emerged; these were compatible with the location of the society and better than laws arbitrarily imposed.
Just as Paris is seen as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It gained a reputation as a center of luxury around 400 AD and maintained this fame until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century due to the return of the Crusaders with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
The title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris in these years.
Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles from the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the period, following the end of the Crusades, was the beginning of using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and largely organic system that utilizes locally adapted, preserved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively straightforward methods to achieve maximum yield within a specific ecological region.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains true in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together people who feel excluded by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive due to members' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture often express their belonging to that culture by using a distinct and symbolic style—including fashion, attitude, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to highlight several unfortunate cases involving children who were socialized by adults through neglect, unwillingly, or knowingly abusing them while growing up.
Such children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined to closed spaces by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, this abandonment of children stemmed from parents’ rejection of a child’s severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that others are raised by animals. Some are said to live on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors—to the extent physically possible—resembling those of the animal that raised them, such as fear of humans or indifference towards them.
Project-based learning makes learning easy and engaging, while guiding support takes it a step further.
Orientation support is assistance provided to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project, and is not a learning method in itself.
Guidance support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a guide, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds is embedded in the software and is designed to prompt, guide, and explain procedures that a student might find challenging to handle independently.
Children are placed in Protective Care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even deprivation of custody.
None of the children should grow up in places that are not protective, compassionate, and educational, but unfortunately, reality is different.
We see the Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our expectation from the foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare services.
The Child Protection Agency is responsible for providing all necessities that were not available in the home from which the children were taken.
The internet combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinct features of the internet add extra dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction approaches.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When researchers investigated audience responses to websites, “personal involvement” and “maintained relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as novel incentive elements.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting facial expressions, specifically in fleeting facial movements that last for just a few milliseconds.
It is suggested that whether a person is lying or not can be understood by correctly interpreting, particularly, micro expressions.
In his article titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks noted that people who have difficulty correctly perceiving speech due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity despite this problem.
He even claims that animals, like domestic dogs, can possess such abilities in interpreting human behavior.
Research conducted in the twentieth century has shown the existence of two distinct genetic variation pools: cryptic and expressed.
Change creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
In every generation, the distinction and variation of reunion between the two pools are mixed back and forth.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements with available plant sources.
Moreover, not doing this has serious consequences such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The easiest plant sources to access would have been proteins obtained from leaves and legumes, but it’s not very likely that plants could be digested by primates like us without being cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all the elements, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their “protein problems” in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly after (for about 10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quieter alarm clock, simply to bring you to a state of awareness without fully waking you from your sleep.
If you find yourself repeatedly hitting snooze on your alarm, you could place the clock on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking too much fluid before bed (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) and forcing oneself to urinate.
The inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force becomes. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of the Buddha, but expanded with the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and many techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga awakens Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Energy channels are cleared through the visualization of various deities, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is cultivated.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures drove a wedge between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
Proxy armies would truly fight from Africa to Asia, in battlefields in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places over the next 40 years.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans almost overnight lost their validity after the Soviet Union’s Red Army invaded Poland’s eastern regions, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, and then entered and opened fronts in Belarus and Ukraine.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to carry large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of navies has been to protect your country's, your people's, and your property's ability to transport, while also ensuring the disruption of the enemy's ability to transport their people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic theater of World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, primarily using U-boats, was attempting to halt this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer England, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds, roaming the hills or other pasture areas, and herded similarly to sheep by shepherds—often more commonly known by goat herders who were typically children or adolescents—this herding method is still used today.
Railways could only be built in England in the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and haul larger loads compared to the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Traverses were started to be used quite early on to hold the rails in place. However, it was discovered over time that they could be more efficient when there was an iron strip on top of the rails.
It has become a common practice, but it caused more wear and tear on the iron wagons’ wooden wheels.
As a result, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were put into use.
The first known method of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus, meaning "upright man," two million years ago.
The previous generation, Australopithecus, could not walk upright on two feet normally.
The periods when two legs began to be used are seen in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more consciously towards the environment, participate in environmental movements, and even become activists to lessen future problems, even if only a little.
This is often like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity’s scientific and technological advancements, and that problems have grown even larger due to overpopulation and humanity’s wasteful lifestyle.
After its approval in Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies of what became known as the “Dunlap broadsides” were produced.
The first public reading of the document took place on July 8th in the garden of Independence Hall by John Nixon.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6th to be read to his troops under his command in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The oldest surviving copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist. No original manuscript versions remain.
Today, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Most people don't consider them dinosaurs because of having feathers and being able to fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Nearly all computers in use today rely on the manipulation of information encoded as binary values.
A binary digit can only have one of two values: 0 and 1. These are called bits in the field of information technology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are too general to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The most important sign of poisoning can be finding an open medicine container or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the label to see the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used officially by entomologists for this type of insect.
This term is derived from ancient similarities with bedbugs (cimex lectularius), which have adapted to establish a parasitic relationship with humans.
Both killer bugs and bed bugs are nest parasites that have adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States. This means that Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease seen in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
Couples may decide that having children is not in their own interests or in the best interest of the child.
These couples may choose to make a plan to adopt a baby.
When a child is given up for adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights to allow another couple to become the child's family.
The fundamental aim of science is to uncover how the world operates through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, experiments are not conducted in isolation. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and observation also guides scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including psychology, were widely accepted.
As Greek science declined, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely dependent on the existence of significant intrinsic cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not respond only to external periodic cues have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue a free-running period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase utilized bacteriophages and viruses to introduce their own DNA into bacteria using a method of implantation.
They performed 2 experiments, labeling DNA either with radioactive phosphorus in phage or with radioactive sulfur in protein phage.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations occurring only in germline cells can affect children, while mutations occurring in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora, fauna, and wildlife.
Examples of in-situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and examining information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting the orangutans in Borneo, taking their photos, and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by getting into cars to go to work, passing by other commuters who will soon be heading back to the same places they just left.
In these dynamic reciprocal transportation journeys, everyone is, in some way, reliant on and supporting a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this massive carbon economy is disrupting the stable biosphere state that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear of complaints of a similar level in developed countries, such as regarding water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems receive so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent, or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to work on traffic flow because driver behavior may not be predictable with one hundred percent accuracy.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range; consequently, traffic flows tend to have an acceptable level of consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between three key characteristics have been identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
The first animals to master flight were insects. Their ability to fly helped them escape from predators more easily, and find food and mates with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This provides them with a wider and smaller range of places to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies are insect species unable to fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed, contrary to that, that the Solar System (including the Sun and even other stars) revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn’t feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width reaching six miles.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of their size and the technical perfection of their structures.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom would gaze in awe at the monuments left by their predecessors, monuments that were already over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language spoken by most workers in the state, while Latin is generally used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since all of them could be discovered in nature in their original forms and extracted relatively easily with primitive tools, people have had knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transform into new substances to take on the forms we observe.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetal elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
In short, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the areas of use and frequency of pens decreased.
People no longer have to approach a pencil sharpener, as they now write messages on computer screens.
Who knows what will happen to the usability of the keyboard when something newer comes out?
A fission bomb works on the principle of needing to supply energy to bring together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
This process is, in a sense, like pushing a wheelbarrow up a hill. It re-seeds the core and then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can decay with little or no intervention.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is approximately 70 km thick near, and 100 km thick far away.
It is thinner under Maria, and thicker in mountainous regions.
Because the crust is thinner, there could be more maria on the side. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories center around discovering what triggers or attracts people.
The aforementioned theses demonstrate that individuals internalize certain needs and/or desires as they mature until they reach adulthood.
These theories concern themselves with what causes some people to desire the things they do, and with what in their environment leads them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, when managers begin to supervise and manage their former colleagues, two behaviors can occur. One side of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
These types of managers struggle with making decisions that are unpopular with the majority, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who believes they need to change everything the team does and do it themselves.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes disagreements between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the go-to person for their close physical groups.
Because virtual teams can meet according to changing time zones that may not be understood by local governments, they generally have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a real “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? A purpose of implementing organizational learning concepts is development.
Creativity and mastery can emerge when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organization.
Ultimately, the process of a collaborative organization working to overcome an obstacle can pave the way for a new, innovative process that serves customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation, in addition to encouraging knowledge sharing and internal training.
Melek (2006) describes the Continuity Approach, a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down the research area and makes it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behaviors and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to observe and research brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material support for designing simulation models that help us understand the workings of our minds.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that can automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, responding to customer diagnoses and questions; skills such as handwriting, voice and facial recognition are included.
Each of these skills has evolved into a separate discipline focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems, once found in home computers and video game software, are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
School trips are an important part of all classes. Teachers often enjoy taking their students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Technology delivers the solution by offering a virtual tour. Students can examine the structures in the museum, visit an aquarium, or be captivated by the beauty of artworks while sitting in class.
Sharing a school trip in a virtual environment is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year related to their annual trips to the State Capital, the website is redesigned every year, but older versions are kept online to be used as a notebook.
Additionally, blogs can help students improve their writing. Students often begin their blogging experiences with careless grammar and spelling mistakes, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the most critical audience is generally students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to nurture the interest of followers inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that opens doors to collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school curriculum.
The appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to be more analytical and critical; students can actively respond to online materials, determining their positions in relation to the writings of others and developing their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa, Canada's captivating bilingual capital, boasts numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls, while to the north it boasts the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more underscores why newcomers are genuinely considered Canadian in Ontario.
The vast areas in the north have a very sparse population, and some consist of almost desolate wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: the number of African Americans in the US is greater than the number of citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the islands and, when it comes to wildlife, it is a continent unto itself.
Most of the small islands are independent nations or are dependent on France and are known as luxury beach holiday destinations.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it became very widespread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring might also be helpful for your work (it shouldn't be a very expensive-looking ring).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to things being considered harassment, and that being followed, having their arms grabbed, etc. is not uncommon.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to state you're not interested (just because of cultural differences doesn't mean the behavior is okay!).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and it was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The sultan of Fas rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
If you want to shop in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to do so.
It’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various knick-knacks around the old Medina, but these places are generally geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava flowing from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered much of the city’s streets, particularly the city center.
Even if Goma is reasonably safe, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city has some of the most affordable ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa and also serves as a base for those wanting to climb the Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
When combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu today is a city that attracts tourists with its fame and has an airport, it is a poor city.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
PBS’s special program was one of Henry Louis Gates’s most important stops during Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, largely due to the strong Arab influence rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, extending along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The park encompasses an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a distinct wildlife.
Besides being one of the most attractive spots in South Africa, it is also considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees for the park.
Purchasing a Wild Card, which provides access to various parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks, may be beneficial.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is considered the main focal point for many visitors.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a shimmering column graph, further accentuated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon shore across the harbor.
Much of Hong Kong Island’s urban development has been obtained from land reclaimed extensively along its northern shore.
This is the place the British colonists acquired for themselves, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarban, extending up to 80 km inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India, is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest.
Sundarban has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the borders of India is called Sundarban National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include the last remaining fragments of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², roughly one-third of which is comprised of wetland/swampy areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is currently estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located across the river) throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
It is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance as intercity buses are often full.
Transportation is provided by small, comfortable and sturdy Japanese minibuses to most neighborhoods.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable mode of transport for getting to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high. They have two lanes that are 378 meters long and 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of the bridge's Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous community living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming in the lands known today as Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá, and other indigenous tribes who sustained themselves through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Region of the Red People," was formed in the 16th century following the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous communities.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization lasting three centuries.
Paraguay has largely succeeded in preserving its indigenous identity and character since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The year's biggest tournament is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, check the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged at a value of one to one with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but Sterling and US Dollars may be used. Check with the establishment owners in advance to determine the accepted methods of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving here.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer while the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, and winter while the Northern Hemisphere is in summer.
Montevideo is in a subtropical climate zone. Temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold. Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
They do not have distinct seasons that can be defined as rainy and “dry” seasons. The amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, and the animals should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you need to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and nearly all large animals can be aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous. Therefore, give them space.
Also, remember that scents attract bears and other wild animals. Therefore, avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and maintain a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships belonging to Germany, the USA, and England demonstrated force in this port and refused to leave, thus establishing the port’s unfortunate reputation.
All ships except a British cruiser sank. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The peaceful gathering in the town during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the killing of High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbors, it has many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour region) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches safe for swimming, and many of them have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the area between Waitemata Harbour, the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay, and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches with a variety of shops lined along the coast, sometimes crowded. Swimming is safe.
Its main local beer is 'Number One'. While not a very complex beer, it is pleasant and refreshing. The name of another local beer is "Manta".
Despite having quite a few French wines available, New Zealand and Australian wines might pair better.
Drinking local tap water is perfectly safe, but bottled water is also readily available if you’re concerned.
The concept of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is an 'espresso', a cappuccino arrives piled high with thick cream (not foamy), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but wonderful.
Many trips are organized to the reef throughout the year, and for this reason, injuries on the reef are very rare.
Despite this, consult with the relevant authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the coasts and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can sometimes be seen outside of these times as well.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away to escape.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live permanently in the ocean; their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance allows travelers to have peace of mind knowing they will have a place to stay when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies generally have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also choose other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages including breakfast, airport/from-airport transfers, and even combined flight and hotel deals.
If you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other necessary documents for your destination (such as a visa), they can hold your reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should be communicated to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most participants see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to snag a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that there may be areas of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night, even if the music has ended on the main stages.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're traveling through the North Baltic in winter, make sure you know the location of the cabin. Because passing through the ice causes a terrible noise for those who are sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruise trips also include time spent in the city. Tourist cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos generally put a lot of effort into maximizing the amount of time and money guests spend. They typically lack windows and clocks, and finding the exits can be difficult.
To keep guests in good spirits and please them, there are usually specially prepared food, drinks, and entertainment offerings.
Some establishments may offer alcoholic beverages as a courtesy. However, intoxication negatively affects decision-making ability. All good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing conditions.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is quite low, and it is impossible to drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
Enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck in a blizzard.
Visibility may also be restricted due to fog, snowfall, blizzard conditions, condensation on vehicle windows, or icing.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic generally flows uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The most common usage of the term "safari" refers to journeys made to observe striking African wildlife, particularly those inhabiting savannas.
Animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars more closely, and standard equipment provides a good view as a result.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you’ll get a better view of them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a nature walk, nature hiking safari, or foot safari) consists of a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice.
If you made your flight and accommodation reservations for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you may encounter a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary. However, from the end of March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus will not extend beyond July 2020, when the Olympics are planned to take place.
The prices of the majority of event tickets are expected to range between 2,500 and 130,000 ¥, with an average price of approximately 7,000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Most hotels have an iron and ironing board available, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the fabric to overheat (this can cause shrinkage or even burning in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some regions, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others, it takes a few more minutes for the water to boil.
The effectiveness of filters varies. If you are concerned about this, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a known brand.
Passengers may encounter insects they are not familiar with from their own regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals capable of harming or killing people through force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase products exempt from taxes in specific locations.
Passengers traveling to countries subject to high taxation can sometimes save significantly on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The land between Point Marion and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through secluded, underdeveloped areas.
If you're not used to driving in rural areas, keep your eyes peeled. Steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns await you.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than those in preceding and following sections – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and compliance with them is more important than adherence to a schedule.
It's strange, cell phone signals are stronger here than in other parts of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are as rich and diverse as in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit-filled pastries are common, made with apples baked into dough throughout the year, and with cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Cakes, which are very popular, generally pair especially well with a cup of black, unsweetened coffee.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what’s called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Curry is a dish containing dry herbs and spices, as well as meat or vegetables.
Curry can be referred to as "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In North India and the interior regions of Pakistan, yogurt is predominantly used in curries; while in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
When Indonesia, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, is mentioned, Indonesian food is a general term encompassing the diverse regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another qualifier, this term refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine, commonly found in archipelagos, stands out with a range of simply seasoned dishes. The main spices important for Java are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the feet on either side of a rider's saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but can pose safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting caught in them.
If a rider’s foot gets caught in the stirrup while falling off a horse, and the horse bolts, the rider can be dragged. Some safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
First and foremost, most riders wear fitted riding boots with a smooth, narrow heel.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a rider is falling, pulling backwards.
Cochamó Valley, a leading climbing destination in Chile, is known as the "Yosemite of South America" with its high granite walls and steep cliffs.

Downhill snow sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular activities that involve gliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, also called "ski addicts," who plan their entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and the first ski club for sporting purposes was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking in rural areas.
It's similar, but generally differs somewhat from alpine skiing or mountaineering. These sports are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as being similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover much more distance than you walk. However, you can rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without groomed trails and a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but one that contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to multiple countries means going through numerous visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen Area, in this sense, functions more or less like a single country.
As long as you stay in this region, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member country, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
The definition of antique can vary geographically, as the age limit may be shorter in regions like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be classified as antiques even though they are newer than mass-produced similar items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding its trade is also important for many people in other professions.
Even though it is traditional, not all Sami people lived off large-scale reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, or similar occupations. They mostly used reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. In the Sami region of Lapland, tourism is an important source of income.
While widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Çingene" (Gypsy) is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.

The ideas put forward are mostly superficial, general, and overly simplified in comparison to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for dangerous weather conditions capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can be observed all over the world, and they have varying types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Just like strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and forest fires, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and typhoons are also among the forms and effects of severe weather conditions.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include types such as blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their destination area. Otherwise, their travel plans may be negatively impacted.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for 'enemy perimeter route' will likely provide the address of a local company.
In a course, all the topics normally discussed here are mostly explained with practical experience and in much more detail.
A course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a significant amount of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about trying to survive in the wilderness are common, but publications about overcoming war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents with them on their return journey.
Each government’s willingness to issue unspecified gender (X) passports or to renew documents to reflect a desired name and gender varies.
The interest shown in these documents by foreign governments is quite variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals should not expect to pass through scanners before surgery without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are often a flow of water back from waves breaking on a reef or similar structure towards the shore.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in several deep areas, where a fast current towards the deep water can occur.
Most deaths occur as a result of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible, due to exhaustion.
As soon as you get out of the current, the difficulty of swimming back is no different than normal.
Try to aim for a spot where you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your abilities or whether you’ve been noticed or not, you may prefer to wait for help.
Re-entry shock manifests its effects sooner than culture shock. The honeymoon period is shorter. It lasts longer and can be more intense.
Travelers who can easily adapt to a new culture sometimes struggle quite a bit to readjust to their own local culture later on.
After living abroad and returning to your country, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some habits from your own native culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People may not anticipate the need to be patient and understanding towards passengers returning to the country.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and quietly observe them before the show begins.

The Sphinx was designated as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Different countries have laid claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and with sixteen active bases in 2020, the islands are the location with the most bases.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is situated.
Among others, there are Livingston Island and Deception, whose submerged caldera of a still-active volcano creates a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in Antarctica, located on the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains converge here with the plateau, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, having been split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern section, or the Sentinel Range, includes Vinson Massif, the highest mountains in Antarctica, with its peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Because a satellite phone often doesn't replace a mobile phone, as you need to have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call, which requires being outdoors.
This service is frequently used by transport vessels, including explorers with remote data and voice requirements via excursion boats.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a year off before university without interrupting their education.
Enrolling in a course abroad for a gap year can actually increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Typically, a tuition fee is charged for registration in these training programs.
Finland is a wonderful boating center. It also has thousands of islands, belonging to the "Land of a Thousand Lakes." These are mostly seen in lakes and as coastal archipelagos.
A yacht isn't a necessity in archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a kayak offer a different experience.
Taking a boat trip in Finland, where a boat falls to every seven or eight people, is a traditional pastime.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. However, apart from that, it is quite unique. For example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty.
Most original Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can fully explore the historical city over several days by returning to the ship to sleep at night.
From 2009 onwards, you will not need a visa if you only come ashore by ship/cruise ship.
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and travel to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and cultures, especially for those who have never flown before or who have experienced trauma related to flying.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it’s no different than many people’s personal fears and other things they dislike.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Large payments are made to courier companies to deliver items quickly. Time is often critical in delivering commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies were experiencing problems.
If they sent the goods by air cargo, unloading the cargo and clearing customs on some routes could have taken days.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger. This is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to shell out a hefty wad of cash for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not economical at all. By a rough estimate, you could pay up to four times the normal fare for business class and up to eleven times the normal fare for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are aware that there is a core group of passengers willing to pay a fortune for the privilege of reaching a destination quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The country's official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been greatly affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-declared Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which had its own government and currency but was not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.

In addition to many common species, rare fauna such as the European bison, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and hazel grouse can be found here.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries offer head coverings for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it’s brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this from the pile at the entrance, but these clothes aren’t washed after each use, so you might hesitate to wear these skirts. One size fits all men!

Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today and continue to remain as museums or educational areas.
During their brightest period, when light pollution wasn't the problem it is today, they are generally found in cities or campuses that are easier to access compared to those established in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The cherry blossom viewing known as Hanami has been a part of Japanese civilization since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the most beloved flower is the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor and only he and other aristocratic members around the Imperial Court were allowed to attend.
Plants look their best when in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formally maintained garden, collecting "samples" will also undoubtedly get you removed.
Because Singapore is generally an extremely safe and easy place to get around, you can get everything you need as soon as you arrive.

There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake in an open area to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are explanations regarding this tradition from the Christian religion, but it’s possible it was a ritual symbolizing spring and fertility predating Christianity.
More traditional churches hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night throughout the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin midnight celebrations to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the first animals to come to the islands arrived here by swimming, flying, or gliding.
Due to the distance to Ankara, the mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans first arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals—including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs—have been introduced.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter months, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark for almost every hour.
