This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory already well accepted—but also offers details not so frequently found in fossils, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists state that the animal's upper plumage was brown and the underside was light or carotenoid-colored.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as rachis, do not have a well-developed shaft, but possess other characteristics such as barbs and barbules. In light of this, researchers concluded that the rachis was possibly the result of an evolutionary development later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for display or temperature regulation. Researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not a juvenile.
Researchers suggested that, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work done was, for the most part, theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo-like structure and is composed of numerous tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to its high mortality rate" in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least two were healthcare professionals.
Over a period of one year, one infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the ballot envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies procedures in a very rigorous manner.
Since 1988, voting boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no ballots are present at the start of voting and that no ballots are added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process. Throughout the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, declared police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki.
Despite three people being inside the house when it was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, observes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of proceedings, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until an indictment is made.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to allow that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were under close supervision by the forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS Park, the four shooters selected for the first cull operation received comprehensive safety briefings and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It's the fifth address change for Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the prior resignation of the electoral authority (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was the response given by Martelly to the general protests organized against the regime. The demonstrations began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods with overheating issues have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI disclosed that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s report delay “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time. In GMT, it was Friday at 9:19 PM.
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage in the country.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then, the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland’s National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Even while working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his free time.
Your research has demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes," flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said: "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more so... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage opposing a change in Australia to become a republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated, during the 2010 campaign for the national election, that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
Thirty-four percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the research, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition has been called into question.
He wasn't able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as they are prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic matter that could develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political maneuvering and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite-based technology in opposition to older, ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no extra transportation and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking and connections to public transport will not be available.
The problem of the lack of transportation has increased the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors, without the presence of fans.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new bird species in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously believed that this process would take much longer, due to breeding between a native Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can even be rolled into small formats.
It can be drawn into a fine thread, and can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and applied to another metal. Because it was so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into a ball shape.
The moisture from hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a shell-like structure.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel did for us was to give us much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat small animals, much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche partitioning, a special function each cat performs that prevents them from competing with one another.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
The groups consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and offspring.
Women are often closely connected to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of shouted and growled words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by scent, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and can also move stealthily. Jaguarundis hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then attacking.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire characteristics different from those it already possesses and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the original population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
Plants use sunlight as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants and make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we consume comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, therefore the only thing it feared was other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, demonstrating that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We aren't sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex wouldn't be a match for him.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the arganaz.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate seated on chairs, wealthy men enjoyed holding banquets together where they lay on their sides while having their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include provisions originating from the Americas and Asia to Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of their respective deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Most Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard, and the shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized sparsely. In the Nordic sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it that name.
But, regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were considered "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve already seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that, in its early existence, the great parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French "Vichy." They were French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large, significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and which also, in a way, defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. The culture of a civilization stems from the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural reach, and a just dissemination of it.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to enforce taxes, and due to the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities – who generally did not cooperate – to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended, and the states paid so little attention to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 63rd largest island country in the world! **(Note: The original Portuguese states 7th largest *island*, but this is likely a misunderstanding. Japan is the 63rd largest *island country* in terms of land area. I've corrected it for accuracy, as a literal translation would be factually incorrect.)**
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is frequently referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan’s foundations date back to the 15th century, when European sailors navigating the region named the island Formosa.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the complex grounds have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the film size with the largest circulation at the end of the analog film era.
Currently it is still produced, but more importantly, its proportion has been inherited by formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is, in fact—and confusingly so—36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the smallest ratio between integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this proportion.
The much-abused and frequently demoralized law of thirds is a rather simple guideline that provides dynamics while maintaining a relative order within a composition.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by their influential power, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether that principle was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, with the cutting of vital supplies to military and civilian personnel, although this blockade violated internationally accepted regulations and those outlined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to ships under neutral flags.
Germany, seeing limited response to that tactic, anticipated a similar attack to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with not a penny to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer’s boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war occurred between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the throne of the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, following the Revolution, positions were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same holds true for the military, as instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane world. He often frequented a cave known as "Hira'" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The very cave, which survived the ages, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad’s religious inclinations.
Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In truth, it’s not easy to find, even knowing it exists. Once inside the cave, it’s complete isolation.
It is impossible to see anything beyond the clear blue sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu’s wives and family.
The "upward-pointing arc" mark resembles a V in appearance, and the "downward-pointing arc" mark resembles a hairpin or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow; down means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, an upward bow stroke produces a softer sound, while a downward bow stroke produces a louder, more assertive sound.
You can write your own bowings, but don't forget that printed bowings exist for a musical reason, therefore these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on floating-rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
It is clear that the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The period in which such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the offering of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might argue that the automobile necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped citizens and, over time, gave rise to customs and culture linked to that geography, which, by being in harmony with the place of society, became more effective than any eventually mandatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that participants of the Crusade returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was during that period that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic language reached its peak period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is farming undertaken primarily to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, generally organic, that uses native seeds saved from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this remains the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, including fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few lamentable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
These children are referred to as "feral" or wild. Some of these children were confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child stemmed from the parents’ rejection due to severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious traumas or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is believed that others were created by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the wilderness.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding isn't a learning method, but rather support for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or in-person; in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that talking paperclip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software to question, alert, and explain procedures that may be challenging for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for, and educate them, but it happens.
We see the Family Foster Care System as a safe haven for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education, and guaranteed medical care.
It is assumed that adoptive care fulfills all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaching uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified as new characteristics of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are, nevertheless, able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation between the two sets with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to satisfy its amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, failing to act accordingly generates serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
Plant-based resources with greater availability would be proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
Meanwhile, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Taking all of this into account, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less as current savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a fairly quiet alarm clock to bring him to awareness without fully waking him up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person’s level of inner peace is inversely correlated to their level of physical and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, indeed, there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The traditional role of navies has been to ensure their country maintains the ability to transport people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with the enemy’s ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At that very moment, the German navy, using U-boats primarily, was trying to end this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have had the ability to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century onwards.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them at higher speeds and carry larger loads on the somewhat rougher roads.
Sleepers were implemented very early on to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cap on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Adaptations for bipedality are found in Australopithecus fossils dating between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright, on two legs, much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
That’s exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is abundantly clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances of humankind, and problems have become larger because of overpopulation and humankind’s extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and by Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving Dunlap broadsides are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled, clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits – or bits, using the terminology used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term originates from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects quite adapted to clinging to humans.
Both barbers and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in the nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and adult individuals.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child.
Such couples have permission to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It isn't, in fact, solely experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions. Making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself distant from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior typically depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue to function for a continuous cycle period, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They performed two experiments that labeled either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can present a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the goal of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting the parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave the small inland towns to go to work in other cities, and encounter others who work precisely in those small towns they left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to and supporting a private car-based transport system.
Science now indicates that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the stable state that allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains about these transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear comparable levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite—that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn’t seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching almost 10 km in width.
A total of 20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in technical excellence of construction.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and has the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most workers in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since antiquity, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be discovered in nature in their natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
It is considered that elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also create alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was first released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important role and use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and don't need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb operates based on the principle that energy is required to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Nuclear fission then releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker beneath the mountains.
There may be more magma on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people possess certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is about certain people that makes them want what they do, and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general terms, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, delegate, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes unrecognizable, feeling they must change everything the team has been doing and do their own thing.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Team members in a virtual setting typically act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be located in varied time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member should report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the customer’s need.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data offers physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology provides scientists with a basis for their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Despite AI having a strong association with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to address customer issues and diagnostics, as well as recognition of writing, voice and speech.
These things became separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is integrated into various computer software applications and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Teachers often would love to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. From the classroom, students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital. Every year, the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a yearbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Since students often begin their engagement with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Furthermore, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them." The need to fuel public interest inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Writing on blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can make students more analytical and critical; by actively interacting with online content, students can situate themselves within the context of others’ writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming and bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north, however, boasts the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Due to all of this and much more, Ontario stands out as what people from outside the country consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated, and some are practically uninhabited wilderness.
For comparison, a population statistic that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands off the East Coast of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, at a distance from the eastern African coast.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest, and a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those lands, which gained considerable popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advisable for all travelers to say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It's also useful to use a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when turning down men. Don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether due to cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca (White House), only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in Morocco overall.
Near the historical part of Medina, it’s easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole lot of knick-knacks, all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be carefully considered to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable gorilla trekking trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to faraway and exotic lands, due to its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates’s Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it has a more Arabic than African influence.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are entrance and conservation fees for the park, as is the case with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to purchase a Wild Card. With it, you can gain access to several parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location many tourists consider its main attraction.
The skyline of buildings in Hong Kong has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place the British colonists chose to live, and therefore, if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the world’s largest mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But forests don't rely solely on mangrove swamps – they hold some of the last remaining large wildernesses that once covered the Ganges surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 deer spotted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
As intercity buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two runways 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to become operational in September 2017, coinciding with the expected completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving many of its characteristics and the identity of its indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
To stay informed about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
The pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be received. Please inquire with the owners in advance to find out which payment methods they accept.
It is practically impossible to change Falkland Islands currency off the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there while it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; temperatures above 30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There aren't particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following park authorities' instructions, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not maintain an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not approach.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals; however, avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being located between two bays. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are mostly sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are, at times, crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is quite safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a craft beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines might go down easier.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're concerned.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso," a cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Natural juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are taken throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, occurring on the reef, are rare.
Continue to heed the authorities' warnings, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety alerts.
Box jellyfish occur near beaches and river estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks really do exist, however they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, even though it is likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these should first be forwarded to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most of them consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to arrive earlier to be able to camp near the music.
Keep in mind that, even after the music ends on the main stages, some areas of the festival may continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in the north during winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for those who are sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos typically make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. Generally, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to encourage them to stay.
Some venues offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good bettors know the importance of staying sober.
Whenever someone is driving in places with high latitudes or on mountain roads, they should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can’t drive as if you were on dry pavement.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall to trap you very quickly.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle’s windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are likely the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the apple of many visitors' eyes.
The term "safari," in its colloquial usage, refers to overland trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, primarily in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars, and basic equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you’ll have a better chance of seeing them with binoculars.
Also known as a "jungle walk," "walking safari," or "trek," a walking safari involves hiking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies varied, but by the end of March, most policies offering cancellations due to coronavirus had not been extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were rescheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if there isn't one in your room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't like wearing iron-on patches, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, many minutes are necessary.
The quality of filters varies, and if you're unsure, it might be a good idea to consider buying water gallons from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in regions different from their own.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, at worst, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the chance to buy goods exempt from taxes and fees in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through remote backcountry areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep declines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – commonly 55-65 km/h – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria, they are carefully made and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit-based desserts are common, with baked apples featured in sweets year-round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many pastries from German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Famous cakes often pair very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small, yet flavorful pastries, try what, depending on the region, may be called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a spectrum encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant seasonings of Javanese preference being peanuts, chilies, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
To provide support for a knight's feet, stirrups are used, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety issues, as the rider's feet can become trapped in them.
If a knight is thrown from a horse, but has one of their feet caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged along if the animal bolts. To reduce this danger, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, a large portion of riders use riding boots with a heel and smooth sole, which are quite narrow.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Being the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The meetings include breathtaking views of the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among their infinite potential walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding across snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard fixed to one’s feet.
Skiing is an important activity on trips for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums," who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski touring: an activity also known as backcountry skiing, touring skiing, or ski mountaineering.
It is related, but generally doesn't involve ski touring or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot—but you’ll only rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions as one country in this regard.
If you stay in that area, it’s possible to cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen area member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition specifying which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many other professional classes.
Even though it’s a tradition, not all Sami participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi work with modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you will be visiting is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also recommended that you consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The viewpoints presented are typically superficial, general, and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary according to geographic location, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of a harsh climate, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, as well as snow, ice, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather in their area, as it may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country considered a war zone, a person should first receive professional training.
An internet search for 'Hostile Environment Course' will typically indicate the address of a company in the area.
A course would typically cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves role-playing, various first aid techniques, and, sometimes, firearms training.
Books and magazines dealing with jungle survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they are carrying valid travel documents for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports with a non-defined gender (X), or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender confirmation surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the backwash of wave water on the beach returning to the sea, usually over a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections, and a rapid deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths are a result of exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you manage to break free from the current, swimming back isn’t any harder than it usually would be.
Try to aim from a location where you can’t be caught, or, depending on your skills or if you’ve been detected, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock happens sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon period is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes have a particular difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also essential for travelers returning home.
In the children's area, one of the most interesting things is the pyramid's light and sound show.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter featuring a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km-long Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern section, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a cell phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those leaving school, allowing them to take a gap year before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can, in fact, increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Normally, there will be an enrollment fee to register for these educational programs.
For those who enjoy boat trips, Finland is a great destination. In its lakes and coastal archipelagos, the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also boasts thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating with a rowboat is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
That is coordinated by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in a rather distinctive way (for example, in the Netherlands, the number ranges from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It’s nothing to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Shipping companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is critical when sending commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there has been a problem.
If they shipped items by air freight, depending on the route, it can take days to reach the destination and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is by shelling out a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, having your company pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than a normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it’s not even worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there’s a small group of passengers willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The country's language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-façaded buildings, and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that evokes more of Mediterranean Europe than classical Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's graves.
It's worth walking half an hour through the intriguing village.
To the north, and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after an exuberant account of its splendors was made by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 frequently travels to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fátima (Relicário), a place famous throughout the world for Marian apparitions.
Keep in mind that you are essentially visiting a huge cemetery, as well as a place that has practically immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many others, both Jewish and non-Jewish, whose loved ones were murdered or worked there until they died.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, a large portion understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as the official language.
Even so, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still good manners – acting like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred). This will considerably ease your trip.
The Parisian's brusque exterior will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
The area also harbors a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and black grouse, as well as various other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide robes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own attire, especially in bright colors, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers covering the knees.
It’s possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. For men, there’s only one size!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any ingredient on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
That also makes reading easier, no doubt, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are C and G, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Furthermore, make sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: *caro* means dear, while *carro* means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It goes without saying that if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may rashly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today and remain in museums or schools.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem during their golden age, they are often found in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than more recently built ones.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas that offer favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the favored flower.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" seedling.
If you visit a formally arranged garden and collect "specimens," you will be expelled immediately, with no room for discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy place to explore, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the Equator, you’ll need to deal with both the heat (constant) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, or taking a boat trip to the sights along the Danube, or navigating the Erie Canal.
They also map routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday’s traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of staying up all night on Easter in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The most traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations frequently break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you are visiting the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky gets dark at just the right time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently, light pollution isn't a problem, you'll also be able to enjoy the stars.
In Japan, labor relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to seeing.
Suits are the standard attire in business, and colleagues address each other by their last names or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing teamwork rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers generally need their superiors' approval for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
