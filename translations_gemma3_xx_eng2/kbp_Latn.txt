This translation may not perfectly capture all the nuances of the original sentence. * **Word-for-Word Accuracy:** A strict word-for-word translation would likely be unintelligible. This translation focuses on conveying the overall *meaning* of the sentence. * **"Paa"**: Can indicate emphasis or affirmation, translated here as "Indeed." * **"Lɛɣtʋ"**: Here translated as "medicine," but could have broader implications depending on context. * **"Akɔnta"**: This word is tricky, translated here as "illnesses", it can also mean "problems".
