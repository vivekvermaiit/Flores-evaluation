This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but also offers details that fossils normally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the crest of this animal was chestnut brown on top with a light or carotenoid-colored base.
The discovery also offers insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers deduce that the rachis was likely a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that, although it's the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample exhibits the plumage of an adult, not a chick.
Researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, and not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They have discovered that the Sun operates under the same basic principles as other stars: it has been observed that the activity of all stars in the system depends on their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work done has been primarily theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

In France, elections have traditionally been a rather low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place inside an envelope a pre-printed ballot with the candidate they have chosen.
After the poll workers verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope inside the ballot box and signs the voting sheet.
French electoral law strictly codifies procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting and that no other ballots are added except those of voters who have been duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

The first was the slalom, in which he/she received a "Did Not Finish" on the first run. Thirty-six of the remaining 116 competitors finished with the same result.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth position in the women's sitting class, with a combined time of all runs of 4:41.30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first to finish, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed competitor, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's seated group did not finish their races, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
Substitute Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and her computer."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
Despite this, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Sheriff Court in Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He is being held in custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be dismissed because his image has been published everywhere.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, responsible for the accusations, has indicated to journalists that it will make no further statements, at least until the verdict.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Among other matters discussed, according to records, are the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the PA commits only to accepting it for five years.
The hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot program had to be closely supervised by forest rangers, while the pilot program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Association’s game hunting program of the Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received adequate safety training and instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has announced that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In response, the ministry described Apple’s postponement of the report as “frankly unfortunate.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management has said that no damage has been reported in the nation.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning signs.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages have recently been released, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature labor in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters have also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as I was...maybe even more...I love her and I will find her at the altar...I hope she finds a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those opposing Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their fitness is in doubt due to their complaints.
They haven't been able to take the necessary medication to manage their pain because it's prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number found as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the older technology based on ground radars, so that air traffic controllers can locate pilots with much greater precision and send them more accurate information.
There are no plans to reinforce transport, and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; there is also no on-street parking or park-and-ride facilities.
The concern over a lack of transportation has led to consideration of the possibility that the match may have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that much more time would be required for this process, due to interbreeding between a Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes* (endemic), and a Galapagos finch with a conical beak, *Geospiza conirostris* (introduced).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into figures of the smallest kind.
It can be inserted into thin wires, which can become entangled. It can be hammered or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very fine and layered over other metals. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That’s what’s called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean wet hands, form it into a ball.
The moisture from hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and our view.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed to place a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most notable thing the wheel has done for us is make transport much faster and easier.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including feral domestic cats) that eat small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that each cat has and which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines and live in large groups called prides.
Herds are formed by one to three related adult males together with up to thirty females and calves.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion coalitions behave largely like dog packs or wolf packs, which are animals with a surprisingly similar behavior to lions (though not to other large felines) and are equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is from the same group (the panther genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather resembles a shouted sentence of angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals they eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing out the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with the environment and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main, original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by emigrating to a new island and being unable to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than those it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Their long jaws held more than seventy knife-sharp teeth, accompanied by a supplementary set in the roof of their mouth, so there was no escape for anything that stood in their way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate seated on a chair, rich men enjoyed participating in banquets where they would gorge themselves together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods’ needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
Most of Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland due to a murder and, while traveling west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
However, despite its discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Despite the fact that they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the France of Vichy. These were French people who had signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was named "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civil, related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, with the meaning of city or city-state, and this also defines, in a way, the dimensions of society.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, enforcement of all its acts fell to the state authorities, who were often uncooperative.
He also lacked the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most well-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and they feature the participation of Italians in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making this country the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, we often refer to it, in geographical terms, as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors coined the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island, for the island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began transforming indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital image camera sensors.
The 35mm format is, in fact, a bit confusing, being 36mm wide and 24mm high.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
He says the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned regarding European history.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
Their omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for that reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Brittany initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military personnel and civilians, although this blockade violated internationally accepted laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Brittany mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering large sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different historical periods: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Similarly, after the Revolution, positions were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve them.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army on classes, from this moment on they were based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcend this worldly life. He would frequently visit a cave that would become known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, provides a rather clear image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing it exists, it's not easy to find at all. The isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
You can’t see anything except a serene and beautiful sky overhead, and the abundant mountains surrounding it. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that remains standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward arc" signal looks like the letter V (low V), and the "downward arc" looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it’s facing upwards, it means you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it’s facing downwards, it means you should start at the heel (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
Strumming the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while doing it the other way around creates a louder, more assertive sound.
Feel free to add your own notes, but keep in mind that the arc markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four), and the King’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of female merchants to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and muttered threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows fully open.
At a certain point, a member of the crowd held up the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, in order to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the large profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the bedrock profits of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that fostered the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Full Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, conventionally ending around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the human destiny is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a network of roads throughout the country for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a significant component of cultural determinism, outlined by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, as they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century, primarily because the Croats had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at that moment that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, the clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, and due to the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the west with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses native seeds saved from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
The feral child, when raised solely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within certain physical limits) almost entirely identical to those of the animal that raises them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use new computer software or starting a project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or real: put another way, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little assistant clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual building blocks are integrated into the software and are designed to question, demonstrate, and explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, and including extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but some do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of security for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
It is assumed that foster care provides all the needs that were not covered in the home from which they were originally taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivating aspects when they investigated public reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The King's Speech," indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities to interpret human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine forward and backward variation between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failing to achieve this has serious consequences: declining growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult to digest for primates like ourselves, human beings.
However, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
However, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep hours and falling back asleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that makes you aware but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you’re one of those people who restarts the clock while falling asleep, try putting it on the other side of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find peace and complete fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this path is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but spread along the path of love of the Mahayana and through many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (illuminated energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and the two countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next forty years and was fought in earnest, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already been breached and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete throughout the night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and established fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is, by far, the most efficient method of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy’s ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, using primarily submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were commonly kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasture areas, often overseen by shepherds who were typically children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they pulled the wagons with horses to achieve greater speeds and haul larger loads on the most difficult sections.
The sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it soon became apparent that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron cover over them.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means ‘upright man’).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright regularly.
Bipedal specializations have been found in australopithecine fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more respectfully with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering that could exist in the future.
This usually works only as a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have grown due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are known today as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he had his troops read in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that today is still alive. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many characteristics of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex would.
Practically all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Seek first aid instructions specific to the poison identified on the label.
The term "insect" is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient association with cimex (bed bugs), which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both reduviids and kissing bugs are nest-dwelling, adapted to seeing within the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in the best interests of either themselves or their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only method, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; formulating questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in the majority of living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling the virus’s DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus’s protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, whereas mutations in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including plant and animal wildlife.
Among examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns by car to go to their workplace and pass by where the workplace of others is the place they just left.
In this dynamic system, everyone is, in some way, connected to and supports a car-based transportation system.
Science shows us today that this enormous coal economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a considerably consistent range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their bodies.
This provides them with a great variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
There were people who thought what I said was true, but many people believed the opposite—that the Solar System moved towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who live in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper dates back to antiquity, as all of them can be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled more the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they also changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The entire Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
Currently, people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a typewriter.
One can only ask what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus of nine releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust measures 70 km thick at its closest point and 100 km at its farthest point.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
It may be that there are more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to emerge to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what aspects of their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as administrators begin to lead their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is trying to continue acting "like one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often ends in squabbles between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of an online group often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can flourish when all available resources are used efficiently within an organization's functional departments.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the client's need.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the research of cognition. Therefore, it reduces the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behaviour, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of these include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been built into various domestic computer applications and video games.
Themed outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take their students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, and each year the site is updated, but older versions are kept online as a yearbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs “force students to be more astute with the world around them.” The need to fuel audience interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs “can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to online materials (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
To the south lie Niagara Falls, and to the north is the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the quintessential Canadian city.
The population in the large expanses of the north is rather sparse, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a population comparison that is usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach tourist destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it embarked on a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to say she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (it's not okay, with or without cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Banu Marinids used it as a strategic port, then known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House), only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it’s all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city’s streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before undertaking any visit outside of this city to assess the state of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use the boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special “Wonders of the African World.”
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River marking the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark for South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entrance fee must be paid.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of parks in South Africa, or to all of South Africa’s National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider the main center.
The collection of buildings that make up the urban skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a brilliant bar graph, which becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across the Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely populated on land reclaimed from the sea along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonizers occupied, therefore it’s a good place to start if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only mangrove swamps—but also include some of the last remaining strongholds of the powerful jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which around a third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now has 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get around to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it wasn't possible to travel across it until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs facilities are also expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is today eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament in this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here too, smaller tournaments and matches can be seen at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), with a fixed value equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands’ only bank, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted within Stanley.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although they may accept British and US currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment methods are accepted.
It’s almost impossible to exchange currency from the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so you need to do it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, remain at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, ants, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Additionally, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, therefore avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous act of insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Additionally, nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are plentiful, as Auckland lies between two harbours. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family-friendly beaches crowded with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is "Number One"; it’s not a complex beer, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can bring many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines don’t travel well.
It is perfectly safe to drink tap water, but if you are worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a *tallat* is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes heavily topped with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Despite this, follow the recommendations of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Bottlenose dolphins are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of these months as well.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and stay away from them.
Marine crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind of knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to submit other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should first be sent to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp there, and most of them consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll need to arrive very early to get a camping spot near the music.
It’s worth remembering that even if the music has finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue playing well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected areas.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos generally strive to maximize the time and money their visitors spend there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to encourage guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the premises. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good “gamblers” know that it’s important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or in mountainous areas should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can’t drive on them as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you very quickly.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling or wind-driven snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues with few interruptions throughout the year.
Safari are likely the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to overland travel to view the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and that’s why you’ll have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "rural walk", "hiking safari" or going for a "footing") consists of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you made the booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to coronavirus no longer apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with a typical ticket costing around 7,000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. Many hotels can provide an iron and ironing board, even if there isn’t one in the room.
If there isn't an iron available, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, a few minutes are needed.
Effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and if you have concerns you should consider buying water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animal pests with which they are unfamiliar in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people through force, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travellers bound for countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through remote, wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: they are characterized by steep slopes, narrow stretches, and sharp bends.
The speed limits indicated are notably lower than those on other preceding and following sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than usual.
Although it may seem surprising, mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and Bavarian pastry is abundant and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbours.
Fruit-filled pastries are common, with cooked apples inside the pastries all year round and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits. The most well-known pastries often pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small pastries, but full of flavor, try what is known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without any other qualification, the term usually refers to the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find throughout the archipelago and offers a wide variety of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people’s preferred flavours are those of peanuts, candlenuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but they can present safety problems because the rider's feet could get trapped in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
To begin, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a thin, quite thin sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if a rider pulls it back when falling.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts many large-scale granite walls and cliffs.
There are breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among their endless expanse of walls.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports consisting of gliding down snow-covered slopes with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums", who plan their entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old – there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, but it was in 1861 when some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also known as ski touring, ski tourism, or ski mountaineering.
He is related to it, but it generally doesn't involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter carried out on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking – although you’ll rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a cumbersome backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, nevertheless, functions as a single country in this respect.
While you remain in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don’t need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition for manufactured items considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handmade products can be classified as antiques, even though they are newer than other similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the marketing of reindeer is also important for many with other trades.
Even within tradition, however, not all Sami people have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami territory.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gitano" is generally considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to any travel alert, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
Perhaps you might be interested in hearing recommendations from governments different from your own, but their recommendations are intended for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East could be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is simply a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The considerations presented tend to be brief, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather condition is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse weather phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal severe atmospheric phenomena are whirlwinds, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travelers monitor any risk of adverse weather conditions that may affect their area, as it could alter their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should take a professional training course.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Awareness Training" will likely offer the address of a local company.
A typical course will cover all the issues discussed here in greater detail, usually with hands-on experience.
A course will normally last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they carry valid travel documents for their return journey.
The availability of governments to issue passports that do not specify sex (X) or updated documents to show the desired name or sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents can vary widely.
Security checks have also become far more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transsexual individuals should not be required to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns after waves crash onto the beach, often at a reef or similar structure.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper stations, and a strong deep current can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you move out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to head to a place where you won’t be captured again, or, depending on your skills or if you’ve been briefed, you might want to wait for a rescue.
Reverse culture shock arrives before culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture often find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you went abroad, at first people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes one doesn't foresee that patience and understanding are also necessary when travelers return home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is quite a tale.
The Sphinx establishes itself as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes of the story are shown above the pyramids, which light up simultaneously.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are disputed by many nations and have the majority of bases, with sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among these are Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km-long Ellsworth mountain range, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum height of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no mobile phone coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is typically used on vessels, including recreational boats, as well as in expeditions requiring remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option among people considering a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among students who haven't finished their studies, giving them the opportunity to take a year off before starting university, without jeopardizing their education.
Enrolling in a gap year course abroad can often improve your chances of restarting higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be enrollment fees to sign up for these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can navigate through coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand have similar rates, but it is also quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
The majority of various Baltic cruises make a prolonged stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic center of the city, spending a couple of full days and returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark for shore excursions booked through the ship, you do not need an independent visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have suffered a traumatic experience.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: there’s no difference with the fears and personal apprehensions that many people express towards other things.
For some, having knowledge about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies charge well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent the items by plane, there are routes where unloading and customs clearance can take days.
The only way to send it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger to accompany it, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a good chunk of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your company to pay for it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of an economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, in eastern Moldova, which enjoys its own government and currency, although it has no recognition from any member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, yet the city exudes an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík you can enjoy views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy. There is also a very unusual octagonal church there.
At the foot of the church there are some interesting marble dove sculptures on some tombs.
It's worth taking a walk for half an hour to an hour and a half through the interesting town.
To the north and easily accessible lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendors was recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly goes to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the grand Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a site of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a place with an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and many women who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked themselves to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by painting or carving graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Nearly half prefer to speak in Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because, by law, it is the priority official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave as well as you can, acting like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). This will make it much easier for you to get around.
The Parisians' brusque appearance will quickly disappear if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, with beech, spruce and fir trees, and is home to a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Enjoy a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils, and diverse altitudes.
The area is also home to a vast variety of animal and bird species.
You can find peculiar fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the wild boar, along with many more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer coverings to women who don't come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should also wear trousers that cover their knees.
This item can also be requested at the entrance, but it’s clothing that isn’t washed after each use, so you might find these skirts uncomfortable to wear. It’s one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple and popular supper, especially in summer, is “Pa amb oli”: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available seasoning such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word “Sie” for you, always begin with a capital letter, even if they are found in the middle of a sentence.
This is a good way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can be said that it facilitates reading, although the writing is a bit complicated because you have to figure out if a verb or adjective is being used as a noun.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowels that follow them.
Also, make sure to pronounce the 'r' and 'rr' differently: *caro* means dear, while *carro* means wagon.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading these basic concepts about grammar will greatly help you learn Persian grammar and better understand its sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is so similar to it that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are largely obsolete today, remaining as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem at the time as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses, which were more accessible than those built nowadays.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an activity known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take “just one” specimen.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden and collect any "souvenir," you will also be expelled without hesitation.
Generally, Singapore is an extremely safe and very easy place to get around, and you can buy practically anything after you arrive.
But by being located in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to cope with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good topic on which to base a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or navigating through the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for well-known hiking and cycling circuits.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christendom, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Even non-believers from Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have adopted many of the traditions surrounding the holiday.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night holding a vigil outdoors to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a spring and fertility ritual predating Christianity.
The most traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations usually begin celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from reaching it, and this led to the giant tortoise becoming the first grazing animal of the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs have been introduced.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will remain dark for almost the entire day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are the standard attire for business, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Workplace peace is crucial, emphasizing group effort over celebrating individual successes.
Workers often need their superiors' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
