This doesn't just confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory that's already widespread—but also adds details that fossils can't usually reveal, such as color and three-dimensional displays.
Scientists say the creature’s fur was chestnut-brown on top with a pale orange-colored underside.
The finding also provides understanding about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers didn’t have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but they did have other feather structures – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than the other structures.
The feathers’ structure suggests they weren’t used for flying, but rather for regulating warmth or beauty. The researchers propose that, although this is the width of a young *dinosaur’s* feather, the sample shows feathers from an adult and not a bird.
The researchers have suggested that, even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the example shows adult feathers and not chick feathers.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to replicate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The result that the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon has gravity, which brings large tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the ninth astrological sign (Sagittarius) galaxy.
The researchers were able to demonstrate that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way that regular matter has an effect.
The theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around a galaxy in a sort of halo, and is made of many small parts.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: one isolates oneself in a booth, places a pre-printed slip of paper indicating the candidate they want to choose into an envelope.
After election officials confirm the voter’s identity, the voter drops the ballot into the voting box and signs under the voter list.

Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Her first was the slalom, where she earned a did-not-finish in her first run. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in the event.
Your other colleague, the giantess Shalom, was seen finishing in tenth place in the women's seating group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11/60 minutes slower than the first-place Finnish Austrian Claudia Läss and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seating group failed to finish their run, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to sort themselves into the finish.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General Kay Area says, "We have arrested five people who kidnapped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjhar, Bhota Kanjhar, Rampra Kanjhar, Gaza Kanjhar, and Vishnu Kanjhar.
Police Superintendent Sandra Schekler Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The street where the crash happened was temporarily closed while rescue agencies freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekayoa was there in Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering her son.
She is under arrest/custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any initial evidence is likely tainted because her image was widely publicized.
This is a well-known performance elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently and courts have viewed the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Vargas, from the University of Dundee, noticed that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comments should be made until indictment.
The document, according to the statement, will discuss the border warfare that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are expected to include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
The State of Israel demands a continuing military presence in the valley for ten years from when the agreement is signed, whereas the PA only agrees to allow such a presence for five years.
The samples in the supplementary fast control group will have been closely monitored by researchers, as the sample was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a partnership of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the acting director for Park Conservation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first cull operation have received full safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new temporary electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It's Motl's fifth CEP in four years. (Note: "CEP" likely refers to a standardized test or certification, and is left as is as it's an initialism likely understood within the context.)
Last month, a presidential commission recommended rejecting the previous CEP’s approval as part of a package of austerity measures to bring the country to new elections.
The comedy was Martelle’s response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The often-wild protests were driven by a failure to hold elections, some already scheduled from 2011.
Approximately 60 reports of overheating non-working e-bikes have been made, causing a number of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
Japan's Ministry of Finance, Trade and Industry (METI) said there were reports of about 27 accidents related to the flares.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company called "unremarkable."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's dismissal of the report frankly “regrettable.”
The earthquake shook Marion at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT Friday).
The Guam Homeland Security Office stated that there were no damage reports to the public.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat.
A former Filipino policeman detained Hong Kong tourists for allegedly being involved in the hijacking of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and although six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as if she needed to use the lavatory. Mendoza was later shot down.
Legins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in the medical field.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Oakland’s National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
During the time he worked in the hospital, Leggins began researching premature labor in his free time.
His research shows that if a hormone had been administered, it would have accelerated the child’s fetal lung maturation.
She reported that government investigators received two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Colleague wranglers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dremer said, "Lana was the first queen of Extremum. My first obsession. Lana died on the night of two white ones [likely referring to two white nights/a specific date]. Very peculiar, just like you. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldast” Rannel has commented that “Luna was as crazy as me…maybe even more…love you and I will miss you…hopefully she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 general election, support for Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Opposition Prime Minister Julia Gillard asserted throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
Thirty-four percent of the members in the survey are unanimous, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those questioned believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health condition became doubtful.
He couldn't get the necessary drugs to overcome his pains because they were boycotted by the Germans.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number today, January 25th.
Some people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was reported on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of bringing water to the Earth-globe, together with organic matter which could have formed proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets crashed into the Earth long ago.
Koma, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political fluff and nonsense."
He is considering running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology in contrast to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to accurately pinpoint aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is being added, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on site.
The fear of a lack of transportation has raised the possibility that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without any team support.
A study published on Thursday in the journal *Science* reported on the proliferation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species arose in only two generations, although it was assumed the process took much longer, due to interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of forms, it can be rolled into tiny forms.
It can be woven into your threads, which can be bent and flattened. It can be hammered and twisted into leaves.
It can be made very thin and inserted into other metals. It can be made so thin that it was once used to cover the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called a cabbage pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH measure is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH ions) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are protons whose electrons have been stripped from them (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together the two dry powders and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze it together into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layers, which will feel different and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Haropa and Mohedza-Darau boasted a flush toilet in almost every apartment, claiming to have an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of plumbing systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Knossos and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilizations, toilets were often part of an open bathing room where men and women were together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, do you use a satellite?
The satellite in the spheres receives the call and then reflects it back down, almost to the minute.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our readings and visual power.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in extraordinary ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and rule.
Finally, there are many small felines (containing beloved domestic cats) which eat a far more numerous quantity of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that every cat possesses which prevents it from fighting with others.
The lions are the most social cats, which live in large groups and are called prides.
Raids are made up of one to three related adult males, together with as many as thirty females and young children.
The women are typically closely connected to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Living prides behave very similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very fatally focused regarding their victims.
A good athlete in every way, the tiger can crawl (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times as much strength as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger’s growl isn’t like the full-throated, booming growl of a lion, but more like a sentence of snarling, screamed words.
Snakes love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals caught by snakes are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that snails go and find animals to eat (forage) through smell, tasting where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well at night with night vision, and also move with great caution. Aselots catch their prey by appearing to circle around and around it, and then leaping onto their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they come from – as if they move across mountains or water, or if they settle on a new island and cannot easily return – they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different aids and different competition, so the new population will need different means and different exchanges to be a strong competitor than what they previously demanded.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
With time, as the new population began to accustom themselves to their new surroundings, they began to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they won’t be able to call themselves the same kind.
We call the process speciation, which means only the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We make our houses from straw and make clothes from straw. Most of the food we eat is grown. Without straw, animals wouldn’t have been able to exist.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long mouth was lined with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of his mouth, meaning it was impossible for anything that merely grazed his path to escape.
We don’t know for sure, but it may possibly have had a forked tongue. His diet included grouse, large fish, other mammals, and it’s possible he was a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex isn’t safe from it.
Although most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans did have a portion of interesting or unfamiliar foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a creature called dormouse.
Another distinction was that while the poor people and the women ate their food while sitting on benches, the wealthy people loved to have banquets together where they could recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Very old meals couldn't incorporate foodstuffs that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn’t have carrots, not tomatoes, not potatoes, not cocoa, and no old Roman ever tried a Turk.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to idols, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the idols through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner space where only the priests can enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The tip of the tower was a special shield for God.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, the house wasn't as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened openly under the sky.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; businesses are currently open with tables looking out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the Land of Canaan, therefore wood was exceedingly expensive.
Greenland was settled terribly/harshly. In Norse legends, they say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But apart from his discovery, Eskimo tribes already inhabited there at that time.
Even though every land was 'Scandinavia,' there were many differences between the people, kings, leaders, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever watched the Mowi National Treasure, it's possible you hold that a treasure map was written under the Declaration and Independence.
However, it turns out Yents isn't telling the truth. Even though there's something written on the bottom of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Freedom with the date July 4th, 1776." These words appear at the bottom of the document, inverted.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that initially the large-format document (it measures ¾29 inches by ½24 inches) was prepared for storage.
If so, it appears the notice was simply added as a label.
D-Day landings and the following battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not yet free.
It was characterized by the “Vichy” French, who were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked Southern France; the attack was called "Operation Dragon."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and then advanced into Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture participated in by a significant large group of people who live and work together/cooperatively, a society.
The word “civilization” comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning human, connected to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and that also signifies the grandeur of the community.
City-states are the progenitors of nations. A civilized culture means transmitting knowledge through countless generations, cultural debates that continue, and equal dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as legitimate civilizations.
Throughout the Revolutionary War, the thirteen cities initially formed a weak central government—with Congress being the sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judiciary, it relied on municipal authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
It also didn't have the authority to overturn textual laws and tariffs between countries.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states so weakened the central government that their contributions were often lacking.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are mostly popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan holds close to 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Because of its cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical standpoint, as an "archipelago."
Taiwan’s history begins back in the 15th century when European sailors, while passing by, recorded the island’s name as “Ila Formosa,” or “Beautiful Island.”
In the year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Indigenous agricultural production practices, and providing work for Chinese laborers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized power, gaining control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal regions and declaring Taiwan to be a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it relinquished control over Taiwan and Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings by the shores of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better sense of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Matchbook pictures were flipped and the flipping continues to this day.
For example, the most well-known still image photography format in the world is 35 millimeter, which was the dominant film mass at the close of the analog film era.
It is still being produced today, but far more important than that is the side information being preserved by the digital camera image censorship format.
The 35mm display is precisely, a little confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of the display (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) was therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many familiar formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or very closely approximate the aspect ratio.
The heavily-overused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that makes things lively while maintaining a sense of order in a picture.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds, both lengthwise and widthwise (see example).
Throughout the ages in European history, the Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, came under critical observation.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion obligated European states to cooperate despite differences in language and cultures.
His penetrating power affected everyone from the king to the simplest citizen.
One of the tenets of the Christian faith is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are specifically for that purpose.
The central authorization of the church has already been in Rome for over a thousand years, and its concentration of power through money has led to many questions about whether that particular belief was fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a novel blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off important military and civilian facilities, although the blockade was against the accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
England mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the sea, causing danger even to neutral ships.
Because there was limited reaction to the tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The prevailing sentiments of most citizens and peoples throughout the 1920s were of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelty of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a songbook, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China has a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family that was in power was a unique dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, occurring for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
Throughout the ages, fierce wars have occurred between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The 'Three Kingdoms' period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people perished fighting to sit in the highest position in the opulent palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not just to one leader.
Even after the revolution, positions were open to all male applicants, leaving the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber/competence.
The French Revolution also influenced many other oppressed workers from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside of his everyday life. He often went to a hermit who became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
He himself fell into it, having survived the times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual yearning.
Located above one of the mountains north of Mecca, the sanctuary is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it’s mostly not easy to find, even though everyone knows it exists. Once it’s in the hole, it’s a total disillusionment.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, glorious sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the world can be seen or heard from within this grove.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The “upward pointing” sign looks like a V and the “downward pointing sign” like a staple or like a box missing its bottom side.
To go up, you should start at the heels and push with the sticks, and to go down, you should start at the frogs (that’s where your hand grabs the sticks) and drag the sticks.
An up-bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more firmly established.
Feel free to enter your own markings, but remember the printed bending marks are there for a musical reason, and therefore should generally be respected.
The distraught King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on October 6th, 1789.
In a wagon, they traveled back to Paris, surrounded by a rowdy crowd who were shouting and hurling insults and threats against the king and queen.
The masses of people forced the king and queen to have their carriage windows wide open.
Somewhere, a member of the masses struck the head of a royal guard who was murdered at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the annexation of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people alone.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regimes to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds made in the name of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Certainly, the substantial profits obtained from the long exploitation of the Filipino population would have constituted the core benefit of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the development of the order.
The period that you spend are often referred to as the High Middle Ages, the time of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages come after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological willingness is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas and implementations, from technological push or the technological demand to a strong feeling that human fate is guided by an inner logic connected with scientific laws and their development in technology.
Most translations of technological terms share the same two general ideas: that development itself follows a course primarily external to cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, “acts upon” societies that are inherited, and not under societal conditions.
For example, one could say that the motor car leads automatically to the development of highways.
However, a nationally broad road network is not economically feasible for only a handful of cars; therefore, new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A high number of car owners also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the creation of new technology in the medical field for healing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determination, drawn out by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography constricted individuals, and throughout time, customs and culture arose connected to that geography, and those, being at peace with the place of society, were better than senseless, predetermined laws.
Just as Paris is known to be the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of early Europe.
It is known for being an epicenter for luxury, starting from around 400 A.D. and lasting until around 1100 A.D.
Its status diminished throughout the twelfth century, mostly being attributed to the fact that Crusaders returned bringing with them gifts like silk and spices which became more plentiful than what the Byzantine market had offered, therefore.
It was the time when the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style was at its peak during the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the established communication channels, styles in the West can be outdated by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted for the production of just enough food to fulfill the needs of the agriculturist and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds native to the eco-region along with planting rotation or other very simple methods to obtain the most yield from plantings.
Historically speaking, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and that is still the case today with many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together similar people who feel abandoned by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of their own identity.
Subcultures can certainly be different due to the vintage, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these things.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a typical and emblematic use of fashion, which includes modes, etiquette, and slang.
One of the most well-known methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to create stories from the numerous unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, did not have interaction with adults during their upbringing.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Certain feral children were raised by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, the child’s abandonment came about due to the parents’ refusal to cope with a child’s severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Foster children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma prior to becoming foster children or running away.
Others claim they were attacked by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness alone.
When fully raised by non-human animals, the feral child will exhibit behaviors (with physical limitations) almost entirely like that of a certain beast of burden, such as their fear of or indifference towards humans.
Even though project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step too far.
Scaffolding isn’t a method of learning, but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of a scaffold, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded within the software and are designed to prompt, assist with, and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to navigate alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even abandonment.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that isn’t nourished, doesn’t show affection, and doesn’t provide education, but they do.
We are looking at the foster care system to be a protective zone for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and accessible health care.
Foster care is obligated to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were removed.
The internet combines elements of both masses in interpersonal communication.
The familiar character of the internet leads to other aspects of use and access to satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personalized persuasion” and “ongoing connection” were also identified as new motives by Aimei and McCord (1998), when they investigated looking-at-sugar reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements which last for a few seconds.
Separately, it is reported that someone can detect if a person is lying by accurately assessing micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper on the President’s speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless assess truthfulness correctly.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior could be involved by animals, like domesticated dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic mutations: retained and released.
Mutation adds to new genetic differences, and selection takes it out of the package of revealed differences.
Segregation and recombination shift back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its amino-acid-based craving for growing resources that are there to be obtained.
Furthermore, failing to do so has serious consequences: developing depression, malnutrition, and premature death.
The most accessible grown resource would be the protein accessible in leaves and legumes, but those are harder for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food for animals (maggots, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a high mass of proteins which contain all the important amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors addressed their marital problems in much the same way chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking yourself up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a quieter alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself setting an alarm for 3 AM, it might be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other behavioral-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces one to get up to go to the bathroom.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is connected to the opposite of the amount of anxiety that is in one’s body and mind.
The lower the attachment, the more positive life force is present. Every person has the ability to find complete peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own attachment and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and by many methods of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of pure love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity yoga. Through the visualization of certain deities, the energies are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the enlightened consciousness formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the contrasts of system, process, and culture led to the countries falling out.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was meant to last for the next 40 years and would have been opposed, precisely, by representing armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize throughout the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans were altered overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union’s Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the northern regions of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the fastest way to move large quantities of people's merchandise across the water.
The work of intelligence has traditionally been to ensure your country maintains the ability to lead its people and affairs, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy’s ability to lead their people and affairs.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans tried to help guide men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the Germans, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
If the ice had broken, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer England as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely the first animals domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to regard them as easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were commonly kept in Roma groups who wandered over mountains and other overgrown areas, sometimes goat herds mingled with them. These goat herders were often children or young men, very similar to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of herding are still in use today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon roads only consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to reach greater speeds and haul larger loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads.
Corsets became known quite early to hold the shapes in place. Gradually, however, people realized it would be more effective if one had a stiffener of iron on top.
This turned into a common occurrence, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels on the wagons more.
Over time, wooden wheels took the place of iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, people began walking as early as two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (that is, upright man).
Their predecessor, the australopithecus, generally didn’t walk straight upright.
Dental specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to lessen future suffering to a certain extent.
This is precisely like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we want something that isn’t just a temporary fix, then we should address the underlying problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and people’s extravagant lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, and was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlop.
Throughout the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlop broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the garden of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which resulted in it being read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlop Broadside copies, as far as is known to still exist, are the oldest remaining copies of the document. The original written copy has not survived.
Many contemporary paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds, but which ones still look like a dinosaur?
They have paws with webbed feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, like 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal consolidation can sometimes not become apparent immediately. Symptoms, like fractures, are very general and a prompt diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal contamination can be the presence of an open box of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Consider the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific drug.
The term “insect” is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The word comes from past familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects easily adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are parasitic, tending to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease which affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has found that females are twice as likely to develop MS than males.
A person can decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
The parents can choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can be parents to the child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method practically guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation alone is not enough; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumptions, and asking questions and making observations also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers looked at classical texts and, specifically, at the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Since knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek philosophers and scientific heritage.
Many commonly accepted rhythms in physiology and behaviors are often critically dependent on whether endogenous cycles exist and their production by biological clocks.
Temporal rhythms, which are not simple responses to external temporal signals, have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators which will continue to run several unmeasured cycles even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proofs that DNA is genetic material.
Hersey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two attempts, labeling either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the proteins of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can also have several other effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism appeals to people who are interested in visiting natural places for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and animals.
Examples of outdoor activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to their workplaces and pass by other people’s workplaces – that’s where they’ve now left from.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that the massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
And in developed countries, one rarely hears such claims about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Considering why transportation systems harbor such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual vehicles and cars between two points and the relationships they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic law is difficult because the outcome of a trial cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, they rely on drivers in a logically consistent rank; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be more or less determined mathematically.
To better represent Traffic Plus, connections were made between the three main character traits: (1) Plus, (2) Reliability, and (3) Speed.
The relationships help with the planning, installation, and operation of the railway facilities.
Insects were the first creatures to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily invade enemies and find food and travel more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings back to the length of their bodies.
This gives them a wider selection of small places to hide from creditors.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite—that the solar system revolved around the Earth-globe, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems understandable, since the world doesn't feel the way it moves, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The New Kingdom and Old Egypt marveled at their previous monuments, which were already quite over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City's population is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law-making and official communication.
Italian is also the common language used by those who work in the state, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about essential chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can be discovered in nature in native form and are quite easy to dig up with simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include a small number of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the world is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny fragments called atoms.
Atoms are so wonderfully small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
So, lead became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing have emerged, lead has been relegated to a lower status and use.
People are writing messages on computer screens now, never having gotten close to a blue pencil.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy wagon up a mountain. Shattering the nucleus again releases a little more of the energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they are prone to breaking down with little or no prompting.
The surface of the brick is made of stone and dust. The outer part of the brick is called the crust.
The layer is about 70 kilometers thick on the nearer side and 100 kilometers thick on the farther side.
It’s thinner under the mare and thicker under the healers.
There might be more Marie on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around discovering what makes people tick and what they are like.
The theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which were repressed while they developed into adulthood.
The theories look at what is certain about certain people, what makes them want the things they do, and which things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two approaches can emerge when managers start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum tries to remain "one of the guys" (or a friend/colleague).
That sort of supervisor struggles with making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making estimations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that they must change everything the group has already done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This particular uprising often results in divisions between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are held to the same standards as conventional groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual group members often function as the point of contact for their existing physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional group members because their group can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understandable to their local administration.
The presence of a genuine "virtual team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a peculiar part of a virtual team.
The "unseeable team" is the management team to whom each of the members reports. The unseeable team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for applying organizational learning concepts in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized across the active departments of an organization, cleverness can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new, advanced process to serve the needs of the customers.
Before an organization can be advanced, the leadership must fabricate a culture of progress as well as communicate knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of attainment.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching perception. Therefore, it refines the research art to make it much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and bring about changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which will help us understand the processes of our brain.
Even though AI has a strong association/connotation with science fiction, formally AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with implementing, learning, and intelligent problem-solving in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent work.
Models contain control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, speech and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which place an emphasis on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the worlds of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as built into some home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom. Quite often, a teacher will love to take her students to places you can’t get to by bus.
Technology offers the solution through virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip report is also a wonderful way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett College in North Carolina paint a website about their trip to the state capitol; every year the website is remodeled fundamentally, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with flawed grammar and writing, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also compels students to become more engaged with the world around them. The need to cater to the interests of the audience drives students to be clever and interesting/captivating (Tauvo 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaborative work, and encourages students to take their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Frequent use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can clarify their position in comparison to others’ descriptions as well as express their own viewpoints on certain problems (Aravek, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful, bilingual capital and has a rich array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All the items and more reveal a pretense—everything that is officially considered Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas higher up in the north are quite sparsely populated, and part of it is almost an uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the US than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is, according to all opinions, the largest, and is a world unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or connected with France, and known as luxury seaside resort areas.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, and it became very popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahara, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women traveling should say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It’s helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should note that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand strong (cultural differences or not, it doesn’t make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Moors as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but they later had to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badi'a, and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the Old City, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as dates, lime-scented items, leather goods, caftans, and a large selection of rugs, but it's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, next to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets in the city, especially in the city center.
Although Gamma is quite secure, every visit outside of Gamma should be investigated to understand the situation of the warfare taking place in the northern Kyiv province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as one of the cheapest gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
You can use “bada-bada” (motorcycle taxis) to get around in Gama. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Along with its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for beautiful, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a forgotten city, although its good name—the reputation it possesses—makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the massive highlights throughout Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special *Wonders of the African World*.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has a stronger Arabic look than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 other ecozones, each of which supports different forest animals.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa, and is considered to be the flagship of South African National Parks (SANparks).
Like all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and entrance prices for the park.
It’s possible to also come across an offer to buy a Wild Card, which grants entry to any selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place where many tourists begin and focus their attention.
The exhibition of buildings that create the Hong Kong skyline has become comparable to a beautiful, jagged chart that becomes more prominent when viewed from Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head out to the Kowloon waterfront opposite it.
Firstly, Hong Kong Island's urban development is strongly focused on reclaimed land near the northern shore.
This is the place where the British colonists took for themselves – if you are looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The dense forest in the Indian land is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they include parts of the last remaining sections of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gondwanic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered in water/marshlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from in front of the sub-district bus station (across from the river) throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going to the east and Jucaro/Bumtang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advised to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi with others is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, like Parau (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans to prevent the Oyapock waters from bringing the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana together.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lines of 3.50 meters wide.
The maximum height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn’t open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be completely opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs review points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most remarkable indigenous group who inhabited what is today eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by numerous groups of primitive tribes such as the Guaycuru and Paiaguá, who existed by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as “the giant province of the Indians,” was born in the 16th century as a result of a collision between Spanish forces and the local native groups.
The Spanish began the age of colonization which lasted for three hundred years.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has striven to retain much of its old-established character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competition of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Los Canitas.
Small disturbances and squabbles can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, search Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is estimated to be the same as one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West supermarket.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currency can be; check with the property owners in advance to determine what is an accepted payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, therefore exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above +30º Celsius are normal.
The winter can be bitterly cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the wind and dampness together make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There aren’t distinct “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay away at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It doesn’t matter how cute they look, badgers, elk, moose, bears, and soon all large animals can attack.
Every year, visitors are injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, therefore, give them their space.
In addition to that, they wisely know that scents attract bears and other wildlife, therefore avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on an island of Upolu and has a population of a little less than 40,000.
Opia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port is the site of the sadly famous naval battle of 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
Throughout the war for independence organized by the Mau Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town ended with the killing of the chief chief Topa Tamasis Liluipi the Third.
There are many beaches due to Oakland’s stretching between two parts. The most popular ones are in the three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) is on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Beach in the north to Davenport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and mostly have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The tamariki drive beaches are on the Whitamata Harbour, in the upper reaches of the Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes they are family gatherings on the shore with a good stretch of businesses which stand along the bank. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is "Number One," it’s not a complicated beer, but a tasty and refreshing one. The other local beer is called "Monte."
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For an Australian, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino comes all the way up with cream (a shame), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate comes according to Belgian standards. Fruit soaps are expensive but very good.
Many trips to the peak are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of the factors are rare.
Even so, you should take instructions from authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to insurance warnings.
Jellyfish happen near the coast and near river waterways from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of those times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Mostly, sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the tidal rivers north of Rockhampton.
Ordering in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you will likely be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically put together packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and sometimes assembled flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the proposal or to gather other documents for your purpose (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For certain festivals, the majority of music festival attendees decide to sleep on site, and most attendees consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go in early enough to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main platforms has ended, there may be parts of the performance that will continue to play music late into the night.
A few festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are traveling across the narrow Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, since forming ice creates a dangerous predicament for those most affected by it.
Saint Petersburg district includes time in the town. District/circle passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally try hard to get the most out of the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and arranged entertainment to keep guests in a good mood, and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer drinks on the house. But getting drunk damages composure, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Someone who is going to high latitudes or over mountains should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, driving is difficult and you can’t drive as you would on plain asphalt.
Throughout two snowstorms, enough snow can accumulate to make you stuck, falling in very little time.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by rain or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly without being stopped for a whole year.
Safaris are likely the biggest tourism attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The title “safari” in popular use refers to overland journeys to see the magnificent African woodland animals, primarily on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for a good view.
The lovers, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes ashamed, and you’ll see them better with Spactivon.
A walking safari (also called a "bush stroll," "strolling safari," or walking "outing") involves walking, for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some episodes will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, because the 1964 games were held there.
If you booked your flight and accommodations for 2020 before the pandemic was declared, then you likely have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies differ, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most evening tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Having moist clothes ironed often helps to dry them. Many hotels possess an iron and ironing board ready for use on request, even if no one is present in the room.
If you don't have even a little bit of iron, or you're not bothered to wear bent sacks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you can get one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as this can cause it to shrink, or in extreme cases, burn).
There are other ways of purifying water, some are more effective against certain contaminants.
In some places, water boils enough in one minute, in others one needs several minutes.
Filters differ in their effectiveness, and if you have a concern, you should then consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animals they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people through force, do not qualify as pets.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from tax at specific locations.
Travelers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marian and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through the isolated underwood terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: sudden grades, narrow lanes, and sharp turns dominate there.
Maximum speeds are significantly lower than in the previous and upcoming sections – averaging 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict attention to them is even more important than not.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is much stronger here than in any other area, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with cooked apples in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums which appear throughout the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts from trees. Well-known pastries often go very well with a glass of strong coffee.
If you want to try small but rich pastries, try what is called differently depending on the region – Berliner, pancakes, or krapfen.
A curry is a stew based on herbs/spices and seasonings, together with meat or vegetables.
A compress can be either dry or wet, applied depending on the amount of fluid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and in other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term covering a vast selection of regional cuisines found throughout the archipelago.
But if used with further qualifiers, the title usually refers to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently prevalent throughout the archipelago, Javanese food has a range of simply seasoned foods, the strongest flavors being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Stirrups are footrests for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider but can have safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but remains with a foot caught in the stirrup, then he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To lessen this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most passengers carry travel boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Afterward, some saddles, specifically English saddles, have safety straps that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
Coquimbo Valley – Chile’s premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a selection of granite-sized walls and crags.
Elite climbers include breathtaking views of towering mountains. Crawlers from all parts of the world continue to forge new paths among the endless possibilities of walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include ice skating and snowboarding, are popular sports which involve gliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski bums, who plan entire vacations around skiing at a certain location.
Skiing is very old – archaeological images show skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing is a sport that dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is connected but typically does not include within itself alpine style ski touring or mountain climbing, the latter carried out in extreme territories and requiring much harder skis and boots.
Think of a sloping road as a similar walking path.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover somewhat larger and more extended distances than when walking on foot – but only in rare cases will you achieve the speed rate of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries. Traveling through many countries under normal circumstances, one would expect to go through visa applications and passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen Area works a bit like one country in that regard.
As long as you remain in the zone, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don’t need to apply for visas to each of the Schengen member countries separately, thereby saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no accepted opinion for which manufactured items are considered antique. Some tax agencies call goods over one hundred years old antiques.
Opinions have geographical variations, where vintage restrictions can be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Hand-made products can be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than comparable machine-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around the trade is also significant for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in the large reindeer husbandry, but lived by catching fish, hunting, and trapping, having reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today, people work in Sami traditional crafts and modern jobs. Tourism is an important source of income in Sapmi, the Sami region.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered derogatory due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate portrayal of Roma people.
If the country you wish to visit is the subject of a travel advisory, your health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You will likely also want to inquire about the proposals of governments different from your own, but their proposal is designed for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may need to deal with different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisories are simply a brief overview of the political situation in one country.
The overviews presented are often brief, superficial, and simple in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to bring damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can happen as always in the world, and there are different kinds of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive snow, and forest fires are occurrences and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all risks from severe weather that will affect their area, as this could potentially impact travel plans.
Someone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the internet for a 'hostile environment course' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here, and much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally be 2-5 days long and will include rope play, a lot of first aid, and a few times gun training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery must ensure they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without writing the gender (X) or documents altered to match a desired name and gender changes.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize the documents is equally doubtful.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not have to fear looking out for—or be forced to compromise—their privacy and dignity when going through scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that hook into the shore/beach, often near piers or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast wave to deep water could potentially form there.
Most drownings happen as a result of exhaustion trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Right when you emerge from the water, swimming back isn't harder than usual.
Try aiming somewhere you won't get caught again, or, relying on your experience, and if you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
A rebound relationship comes faster than a cultural shift (there’s less of a honeymoon phase), it lasts longer, and it can be more serious.
People who have lived abroad and adapted to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you are already accustomed to the new culture and you have lost a little of the customs of your home culture.
When you first arrive in a foreign country, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new land need time to adjust.
People will likely not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid concerts and lecture performances are one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see it in silence before the performance begins.
Typically, you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of noise and chatter is just like in a storybook.
The Sphinx is seated as the foundation and the harbinger of a long tale.
The scenes are displayed on the platforms, and the other platforms are observed.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the scattered cold of a still-active volcano provides a wonderful natural harbor.
Elsewhere Land is the area south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the half-island here converge in the plateau, after which they emerge again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut through by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica’s highest mountain, Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 meters with Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cellular coverage, a satellite phone is your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is very often used by shipping, including manual labor, as well as expeditions that have used extensive data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about subscribing to the service.
A very popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially known among school dropouts; it allows them to take a year off before university without losing their educational standing.
With many flaws, taking an interim year course abroad can improve the chances of entering higher education back in your homeland.
Typically, it will cost money to enroll in the learning programs.
Finland is a strong shipbuilding destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on Archipelago Street and the docks.
Even though the calm archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Traveling by ship is a national pastime in Finland, with a ship for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number one to forty).
Most of the remarkable Baltic freight rates stipulate an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for a few filled days and return and sleep on a ship at night.
If you travel to the country only by ship, you won't need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises advertise Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced other trauma.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and unloveliness of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or on not being in control.
Companies that specialize in sending packages are well-paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an important repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it was a problem.
If they send things via air freight, certain routes would take days to unload and go through customs.
The only way for it to go through faster is to send everything as checked baggage. Airport regulations won’t allow them to send anything as baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The understandable way to fly in first or business class is to spend a hefty sum of money on the privilege (or even better, to have your company pay for it for you).
However, it doesn't come cheap; as the rule goes, you can expect to pay more than four times higher than the normal economic fare for business and eleven times higher for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there is a certain main group of travelers who are willing to pay the highest price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they calculate accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic warfare.
In 1994, this conflict led to the founding of a self-declared transitional republic in eastern Moldova, which had its own government and currency but was not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations have resumed between the two parts of Moldova despite their failure in political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once the old city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, built around a vast sea and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glassy buildings, and modern shopping centers coexist with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldorsvik looks out towards the nearby island of Austevoll and has an interesting octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above various graves.
It’s worth taking half an hour to wander around the fascinating village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and interesting town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a glowing account of its beauty was recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scaturbus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass burial site, as well as a place that has almost immeasurable significance to a large portion of the world’s population.
There are many men and women who still live and have lived their lives here, and many others who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this topic with the full dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make any jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not weaken the place by marking or scratching graffiti into the structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half would prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are marked only in Catalan because it is established by law to be the first and official language.
Indeed, Spanish is also increasingly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the subway are reported only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are reported by an automatic system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be eccentric, unreliable, and to act superior.
Although this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is to be at your best behavior, acting like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It will greatly ease your travels.
Parisian sharpness outside will quickly approach if you demonstrate a few essential niceties.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely overgrown, primarily with beech, spruce, and fir trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly wide selection of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, diverse soil types, and many different levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a very wide selection of animal and bird species.
Rare wild creatures such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more familiar kinds of creatures.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and also have the shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries offer shelter to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own eggs, especially ones with light-colored shells, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
At the same time, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the many items at the entrance, but those clothes aren’t washed after each user, so you likely won’t feel comfortable wearing the slippers. One size fits all for the men!
Mazurian cuisine (the Mayorke cooking), like similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens, and meat (particularly pork), and uses sunflower oil abundantly.
A simple, popular nighttime snack, especially in the summer, is *po ambe alie*: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever else is available, like cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, together with the word “si” for you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to be able to distinguish between a few verbs and objects.
It also seemingly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat more complicated, having to figure out the usage of when and whether a verb or adjective is used based on a justified reason.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in the Italian language because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look at are C and G, because their sound changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce R and RR differently: “Kara” means expensive, meanwhile “Karre” means cart.
Persia has a moderately light and generally smooth grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory booklet will help you learn a lot about Persian layout and understand phrases better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish will often be too quick to assume that Portuguese is close enough and doesn’t need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are rarely found/absolutely not in modern times, and remain as museums, or places of education.
Since light pollution wasn't such a problem in their time as it is today, they were commonly found in towns or near campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes for research are huge structures in remote areas with satisfactory atmospheric conditions.
Considering where goshawks fly, also known as falconry, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated from China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewings were held by the Emperor alone and other members of the aristocracy around the royal court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, therefore oppose the temptation to remove even one specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also expose you to being thrown out, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
However, being situated in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will need to cope with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, to the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you're planning to take goes *into* Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to base a holiday.
For example, visiting Schleswig-Holstein, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or sailing to the length of the Eridan Canal.
They’re also noticing about paths for known walks and baking paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted even by non-believers in Christian lands and non-Christian lands around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the entire Easter night awake, at one open point, to watch the sunrise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for the tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night throughout the Easter weekend, with the congregations frequently joining the celebration soon after midnight to celebrate Christ’s resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating on the water.
Due to the long distance from the continent, marine iguanas cannot make the journey, making the giant tortoises the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals—including goats, horses, pigs, rats, cats, and dogs—have been introduced.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, meaning the sun will not shine above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, because the sky will be dark more or less around midnight.
Since the areas have a small population, and lamp light pollution is therefore not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West are accustomed to.
Recruits are typically business casual, and colleagues address each other by family names or job titles.
Workplace collaboration is critical, emphasizing group work over individually highlighting achievements.
Workers sometimes must obtain their superiors’ approval for every decision they make, and are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without question.
