This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but also provides details that are usually unobtainable from fossilized remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top, and either pale or had carotenoid pigmentation underneath.
The discovery also allows one to learn about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but still possess other distinctive features – barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later through the development of these other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. Researchers hypothesized that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample exhibits adult plumage, not chick down.
Researchers have suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, this specimen exhibits the plumage of an adult, rather than chick down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded near the main police headquarters in Gaziantep (Turkey), resulting in the deaths of 2 police officers and injuries to more than 20 people.

They discovered that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: it was established that the activity of all stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The combination of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of a star, related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field reversals.

The work done was mainly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, thereby causing tides, so too does the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way it does with ordinary matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of dark matter around the Galaxy is arranged in a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

During research in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa, Dr. Tony Moll managed to discover tuberculosis with exceptionally high drug resistance (XDR-TB).
In the interview, he said that the new strain "causes very great concern, as it leads to a very high mortality rate."
Doctor Moll believes some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were healthcare workers there.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the entire group of tuberculosis patients still appears low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected individuals at this specific time in South Africa.

In France, voting is traditionally done using low-tech methods: a voter closes themselves in a booth and places a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, they drop their ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French election laws fairly strictly systematize procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no other envelopes are added except those of people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
Candidates may send their representatives to monitor the entire process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict control and in accordance with a special procedure.

In another race, this time in giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in the seated position with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winning Austrian Claudia Leš and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Dénes Danyi.
Four female sitting skiers were unable to finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh state police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants are named Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampuro Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the building at the moment the car crashed into it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services extricate the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Subsequently, the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged Adekoye with the murder of her son.
She is currently in custody awaiting charges and a trial, however, any witness testimony could be biased given the extensive media coverage of her popularity.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish law operates differently, and courts have found the publication of photographs potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem genuinely to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos and other data about suspects."
The Royal Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, told reporters that no further comments would be made, at least until a conviction is handed down.
According to a leaked report, the document will concern a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The marksmen participating in the supplementary pest control test were to be under close supervision by rangers, as the test was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooting Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Acting Director of Park and Heritage Conservation for the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Parks, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation underwent comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martey led a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members to take the oath of office.
This is Martey's fifth CER in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended that the previous Temporary Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were originally scheduled for as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating were reported with defective iPod devices, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 cases linked to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as "minor."
In response, the ministry called Apple’s delay of the report “very regrettable.”
An earthquake occurred in the Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency stated that there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of the elderly woman as she went to the restroom. Mendosa was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating cases of premature births in his free time.
His research showed that introducing the hormone enhances lung maturation in the developing fetus.
According to Xinhua, state investigators discovered two flight recorders, or, in other words, "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to the Moon.
Here’s what Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. It’s such a unique event, just like she was. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Golddust" Runnels said: "Luna was as wild as I was… Maybe even wilder… I love her and will miss her… I hope she’s in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed the opinion during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll showed the following: 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve the pain, as it is prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by the beginning of February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Perhaps comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, as well as a source of organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth a very long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his tenure as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called these rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, will allow aircraft to fly along shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
She is using satellite technology instead of the old technology based on ground-based radar, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No extra transport has been arranged for Wembley, ground trains will not be stopping there, and there is no parking or park-and-ride facilities available on the surface.
Concerns about the lack of transportation led to speculation that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
The description of the research, published on Thursday in the journal Science, reports the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) have reported that, due to the mating of the endemic Darwin’s finch (Geospiza fortes) with the introduced cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought this process would take much longer.
Gold can be given any form. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be woven and plated. It can be stamped or rolled into coils.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books – so-called "face manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline a substance is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of saturation with hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Obtain a new mixture by combining two dry powders in one container, then, using clean wet hands, shape the mixture into a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which will be unusual, and then a shell-like formation will develop.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Surviving fragments of sewage systems have been discovered in the houses of Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and almost instantly reflects it back down.
The satellite was delivered into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and view to some extent.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has incredibly changed our world. Most importantly, what the wheel did for us was give us much easier and faster transportation.
It gave us a train, a car, and many other vehicles.
Beneath them are a greater number of medium-sized cats, which eat small to medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelope and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) eat and hunt much more numerous small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success lies in the niche concept – the specific work each breed of cat performs – which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as females and cubs, the number of which can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to one another and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs—animals whose habits are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats)—and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-rounded athlete, a tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
A tiger’s roar doesn’t resemble the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather sounds like shouting out sentences made of unintelligible words.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. If given the opportunity, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the creatures that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the tracks of animals and locate prey by scent, tracking its movements across the ground using their sense of smell.
They can see excellently in the dark with night vision and move almost undetected. Ocelots stalk their prey, blending into their surroundings, and then pounce.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that differs from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations, compared to those it had previously, in order to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all – it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Over time, through thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that it won't be possible to say they are the same species.
We call this process speciation, that is, the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and an extremely essential part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants are nourished by the sun through photosynthesis. Additionally, they cast shadows.
We build our homes and make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most fearsome predator of its time, and therefore it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with over 70 incredibly sharp teeth, and he had an additional row on his palate, meaning there was no escape for those who crossed his path.
It is not known for certain, but it is not excluded that his tongue was forked. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex wouldn't compare to him.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans still had their own strange and unusual dishes served during feasts—for example, boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a dormouse.
There was another difference: while the poor people and the woman ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy enjoyed holding joint feasts during which they ate lying on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not have included products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
Specifically, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main sanctuary for each of the gods, considered to be the god's dwelling.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests strove to satisfy the gods’ desires during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special towers in the form of pyramids called "ziggurats" were built as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house didn’t hold much significance.
Much of the Jewish family’s life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and, traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think there was a treasure map depicted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence is written: "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up for more convenient storage.
Thus, it is quite likely that the entry was added simply as a note.
As a result of Operation Neptune and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south remained under occupation.
He was under the control of “Vichy” Frenchmen. These Frenchmen signed a peace treaty with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of resisting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France. The invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
In just 2 weeks, the forces of Free France and the Americans liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture, carried by a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning "civic," and is related to the Latin words *civis*, meaning "citizen," and *civitas*, meaning "city" or "city-state," and it also, in a certain way, expresses the scale of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, a continuous cultural presence, and a sustained dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving corresponding historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, whose only branch was Congress.
Congress lacked any powers to levy taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the state governments, which often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all of its acts.
He also lacked the authority to overturn state tax laws and tariffs.
To amend, according to the articles, unanimous approval from all states is required, but the states treated the central government so irresponsibly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions. Residents of Italy from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 63rd largest island country in the world! **(Note: The original stated 7th largest *island* which is incorrect. Japan is the 63rd largest *island country*. I’ve corrected it for accuracy, maintaining the spirit of the original sentence.)**
Due to its belonging to a cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan’s history dates back many years, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island.”
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded rights to Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings around the perimeter of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for static photographs is 35mm, and this size was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sizes of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing – it’s 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio with small whole numbers) is therefore accepted as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) have or closely approach these proportions.
The rule of thirds, often overused and frequently mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while still maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It states that the main object is best placed at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become wealthy and powerful, found itself the object of close scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and traditions.
Her all-pervading power touched everyone – from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s funds exist precisely for this purpose.
The center of church power was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was being observed.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy proved its effectiveness by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws outlined in numerous international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Among most citizens and peoples in the 1920s, sentiments such as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America and accepted a job offer to work at the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who had been his supervisor at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, a unique method was used to denote periods of time; each stage of China or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, fragmentation and instability reigned between the rules of each dynasty. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce military actions took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people perished fighting for a place on the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous such social and political effects as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to its people, not a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, work opportunities opened up to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
The same applies to the army, because ranks began to be based on qualities, not on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in topics unrelated to worldly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light), for contemplation.
And the cave, which has survived to this day, vividly gives us an idea of the spiritual aspirations of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the mountaintop north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
She is very difficult to detect, even for someone who knows she exists. In the cave, a person finds themselves in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky above and the multitude of surrounding mountains. From the depths of the cave, one can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu’s wives and his relatives.
The up-bow mark looks like a V, and the down-bow mark looks like a parenthesis or a square without a bottom side.
"Up-bow" means you should start from the tip and draw the bow forward, while "down-bow" means you should start from where your hand holds the bow and draw it backward.
Moving the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while moving it downwards produces a louder and more forceful sound.
You can create your own shading, but remember that the shading is printed for musical reasons, and it’s usually best to follow it.
On October 6, 1789, an enraged crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Élisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of a frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on bond loans transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits extracted from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos constituted the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated their creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of practical ideas, from technological progress or technological imperative to the strict viewpoint that the fates of people are driven by the fundamental logic connected to the laws of science and their manifestation in technologies.
Most views on technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technological development is largely immune to cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the “impact” of technology on society is determined by its own inherent properties, rather than by society itself.
For example, one could say that the automobile is a necessary cause for the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically disadvantageous for only a small group of vehicles, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in traffic accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the development of new trauma treatment methods in healthcare.
Romanticism largely incorporated cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and culture associated with it arose, which, being in harmony with the place of residence of a given society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so too was Constantinople considered the fashion capital in the times of feudal Europe.
Fame of it as a center of luxury spread around 400 AD and continued approximately until 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the twelfth century mainly because Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of Fashion Capital transitioned from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west may lag behind by 25-30 years.
Distinctive styles began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest achievements of that time, facilitated by the Crusades, was the use of buttons for fastening clothes.
Natural farming is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family only.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, system of agriculture that utilizes seeds from plants native to the ecosystem, along with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods for increasing yields.
Historically, most farmers have practiced agriculture for subsistence, and this is still observed in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards, and allow these people to define who they are for themselves.
Differences between subcultures are possible, determined by the age, nationality, social status, place of residence, and/or gender of the people who comprise them.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their affiliation through a unique and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to present several unfortunate cases where children, due to a lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate abuse, did not have contact with adults during their upbringing.
Children like these are called "feral" or "wild." Some feral children were isolated by people (usually their own parents). In some cases, such abandonment of a child was a result of the parents' rejection of their serious intellectual or physical disability.
Children living on the streets may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before running away or being abandoned.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he has been raised entirely by animals rather than people, a feral child demonstrates habits (within the limits of physical constraints) that are, in almost every respect, similar to those of the specific animal that raised him – for example, its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should be simpler and more engaging, scaffolding outpaces many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a form of support for those going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is Clippy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding, aiding in learning, is built into the software and designed to remind, explain, and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle alone.
Children are placed under guardianship for a variety of diverse reasons: from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never grow up in an environment where upbringing, care, and education are not provided, but they do grow up nonetheless.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scales in terms of usage and satisfaction approaches.
Thus, the idea has been put forward that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “long-term contacts” were also identified by Eimmy and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions — facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks described how people who, due to brain damage, are unable to understand speech can nevertheless correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
According to his hypothesis, animals, such as domestic dogs, may possess similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variability: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system like that of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so will lead to such serious consequences as slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are poorly digested by primates like us unless cooked.
Conversely, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also a rich source of proteins containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything said above, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way chimpanzees in the savanna do to this day.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly hitting snooze in your sleep, you can put your alarm clock on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (specifically water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which causes a person to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person experiences is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present within you. Every person is potentially given the ability to attain absolute peace and a sense of fulfillment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was supplemented by the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and a multitude of techniques from Indian yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in Kundalini Yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered to be Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, contradictions regarding the system, process, and culture led to discord between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
She was destined to last another 40 years. Real fighting took place within her, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places around the world.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken through, and the only hope lay in retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant practically overnight when approximately 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after seizing eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to carry large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
The work of sailors traditionally consists of ensuring the country's ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving theirs.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was a company in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, primarily using its submarines, attempted to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would most likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for themselves to have milk, wool, meat, and hides readily available.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goatherds who were usually children or teenagers – a role similar to that of a more common shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Roads for carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although corduroy roads consisted only of wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses to transport larger loads and at a higher speed than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Railroad ties began to be used quite a long time ago to hold the rails in place. However, it later became clear that the tracks were more effective with an iron strip on top.
It became common practice, but iron led to greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transportation was walking, with people beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
For their ancestors, the australopithecines, upright posture was not so natural.
Bipedal specializations are found in the remains of australopithecines from 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living by taking better care of the environment. We can become members of an environmental movement and even become activists to alleviate future suffering, even if only a little.
As a rule, this is like treating the symptoms. If we need more than just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed significantly under the influence of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and due to overpopulation and people's extravagant lifestyles, the problems have become more масштабные ( масштабнее - more масштабные is a more literal translation, but "larger" or "more significant" also work well in context). Alternatively, a slightly more natural-sounding translation: It is quite clear that the world has changed dramatically due to humanity’s scientific and technological advancement, and problems have grown larger because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent several blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of this document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, one copy was sent to George Washington, who on July 9th ordered it to be read aloud to his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 leaflets of Dunlap, known to date, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived to our time.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived on to the present day. We call them birds.
They are often not considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and are capable of flight.
But much more can be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled paws with claws, they lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is, 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" – or "bits" when using computer jargon.
It can be difficult to immediately identify oral poisoning. Symptoms like vomiting are too general for a quick diagnosis.
The best sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for specific first aid instructions in case of poisoning by this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used formally by entomologists to denote a group of insects.
This concept originates from bed bugs – insects well-adapted to parasitizing on humans – known since ancient times.
Both predators and bed bugs are nest-dwelling species adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been identified in the United States, making MS the leading neurological disease among young people and adults of middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that twice as many women suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child does not align with their interests or the interests of their child.
These couples may choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
When a child is adopted, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child’s parents.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world is structured, using the scientific method. This method essentially underlies most scientific research.
However, he is not the only one. Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and conducting observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on ancient texts, and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, not simply a reaction to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue autonomous cyclicity for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages—viruses—to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can cause a large number of diverse outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who enjoy traveling into nature to appreciate the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Among the examples of outdoor activities available on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to get to their jobs, while those whose workplaces are in the places they just left drive past them.
In this active traffic flow, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on personal automobiles in one way or another.
Currently, science indicates that the vast hydrocarbon economy has impacted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems. Practically everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about the transportation systems, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other, is carried out within the framework of traffic flow research.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic intensity, because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior is often sufficiently systematic; therefore, traffic flows as a whole exhibit some regularity and can be approximately described mathematically.
To better understand traffic flow, relationships were established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them more easily escape from enemies, find food, and find mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This provides them with more secluded spots to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Many believed him to be right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a reasonable idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching a width of six miles.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River’s main stream is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Despite the fact that the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired monuments created by their predecessors over a thousand years prior.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, as well as the country with the smallest population.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also an everyday language for most people working in the government, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements—such as gold, silver, and copper—since ancient times, as all of them can be found in nature in a pure form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also suggested they transition into a new state to become what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
It is also possible to make alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it appeared.
It's sad that when new ways of writing appeared, the pencil lost its former status and people started using it less.
Now people type messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard with the emergence of newer technologies.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to keep many protons and neutrons within a single nucleus.
Roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, repeated nuclear fission releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they are prone to decay with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust thickness is about 70 km under oceans and 100 km under continents.
She is thinner under lunar seas and thicker under mountains.
On the near side, there may be more lunar maria because the crust is thinner there. Lava found it easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people to act or might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally throughout the process of growing up.
These theories address what motivates specific people to do what they do, and what in their environment causes or prevents them from doing certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
As a rule, two types of behavior can manifest when managers begin to lead people who were previously their equals in status. One extreme of the spectrum is attempting to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
It is difficult for such managers to make unpopular decisions, take disciplinary measures, evaluate work results, delegate responsibilities, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team did and take credit for it.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical team.
They are typically more self-sufficient than employees from traditional teams, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of this actual “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is a team of leaders to whom every participant reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each participant.
Why should organizations go through the laborious process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of applying the concepts of learning organizations in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional units of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Ultimately, the concerted effort of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the client’s needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and experience accumulation.
Angel (2006) explains the "Continuum" approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Data from neurobiology provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Thus, the scope of research narrows, and it becomes much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes previously unseen.
This provides us with a large volume of data and materials for creating simulation models, helping us to understand the processes occurring in our consciousness.
Despite the fact that AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important field of computer science, examining machine behavior and learning, and "imbuing" them with intelligence.
Research in the field of AI includes the creation of machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be given: control, planning and scheduling, responding to diagnoses and client questions, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
Such questions are singled out into separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve problems we encounter in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, being integrated into some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Educational excursions are very important for any class. Very often teachers want to take their students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can examine museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or enjoy beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Presenting a tour in a virtual space for public viewing is also a great way to refresh the tour in your memory and share your gained knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year this website is updated, but access to older versions is still maintained – they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogs with sloppy grammar and spelling, this generally changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, by maintaining a blog, “students begin to better understand the world around them.” Students are inspired to be intelligent and interesting, attracting the attention of readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration, and it motivates students to extend the learning process far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical thinkers. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their position in relation to the work of others, as well as articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada with a wealth of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north is the domain of the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of this and much more makes Ontario something truly Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
An amazing population comparison: there are more African Americans in the US than citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than other islands and is a unique continent in terms of its wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this region, particularly taking root on Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route around the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may perceive actions as harassment – women are often followed, their hands are taken, and so on.
Firmly refuse men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt a city called Eddar el-Beyda, while Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole assortment of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city on the far eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of town.
Although Goma is a relatively safe place, it is advisable to check information about any trips outside of Goma in advance to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
This city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, and it’s also a place where you can see mountain gorillas in the wild for one of the lowest prices in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to Goma. The usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for a distant, exotic land.
Today, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s "Wonder of the African World" for PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
This city differs greatly from other cities in the country, as it has a predominantly Arab flavor, rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River serving as its southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km²; it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for various wild animals.
He is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading among South African national parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, this park has a daily fee for its protection and visitation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South African national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after Hong Kong Island, a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus of their attention.
The string of buildings forming Hong Kong’s skyline is compared to a glittering bar chart, underscored by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most picturesque places in Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the coast of the Kowloon Peninsula, which lies opposite.
The majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, then this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest contiguous mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not simply mangrove swamps—they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq. km, about a third of which is covered by water or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that it currently harbors around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and reliable Toyota Coaster buses.
A minibus is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (150 Ngultrums) and Punakha (200 Ngultrums).
The bridge across the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers reach a height of 83 meters, while the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes of traffic, each 3.5 meters wide.
The underbridge clearance is 15 meters high. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
According to the plan, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region served as home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Paiagua, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "vast province of the East Indies," emerged from the clash between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its distinctive character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams, as well as the best players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is taking place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at other times of the year.
To find out the latest news about polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on these islands, located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
As a rule, British pounds will be accepted everywhere on the islands. Credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency might be; clarify in advance with the owners which payment method is acceptable.
The Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than the thermometer indicates.
There aren’t particularly “rainy” or “dry” seasons here: the amount of precipitation is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so you shouldn't feed or disturb the animals.
The park administration warns: do not approach bears and wolves within 100 yards/meters, and all other wild animals within 25 yards/meters!
No matter how docile they appear—bison, moose, bears, and practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their personal space.
Furthermore, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking or carrying strongly scented food, and also keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All the ships sank, with the exception of one British cruiser. Around 200 American and German sailors perished.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here, as Auckland is located on the shores of two harbors. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy with safe swimming, and many of them are shady thanks to trees such as the pohutukawa.
Along Tamaki Drive, in Auckland’s central district where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers are located in Waitemata Harbour, stretch the beaches.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The most popular local beer is "Number One," it has a simple, pleasant, and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that are good to drink, however, New Zealand and Australian wines can be transported better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still concerned, bottled water is readily available.
Australians don't understand the idea of a "flat white." A "small black" is an espresso, they serve cappuccino with a thick layer of whipped cream (not foam), and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
A large number of trips are made to the reef year-round, and injuries caused by any of these reasons on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the recommendations of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks do indeed exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not lead an active life in the ocean, and their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows a traveler not to worry about where to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book other types of accommodation through a travel agent as well, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages including flights and hotel accommodation.
In addition, they can hold the booking if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests need to be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees camp directly on the festival grounds, and most of them consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the stage, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages has already ended, there may be areas at the festival where music will continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, inquire about the location of your cabin, as passage through the ice creates a rather unsettling noise that can disturb the sleep of more sensitive people.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (please check the conditions).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to keep visitors inside as long as possible and spending as much money as possible. There are no windows or clocks there, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol. However, intoxication clouds judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to travel through high-latitude areas or mountain passes should be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you won’t be able to drive as you would on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, a sufficient amount of snow to get stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited due to snowfall, blizzard, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, weather conditions with snow and ice are normal in many countries, and road traffic continues year-round with almost no interruptions.
Safari is probably the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the highlight for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage refers to a land journey to observe the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, often approach cars, so you can get a good view even with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you should observe them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walking", "hiking safari", or "pedestrian safari") consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will become the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice. They were first held here in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the date change was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the rules related to coronavirus did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards for rent, even if they are not available in the room.
If you don't have an iron handy or aren't thrilled with the idea of wearing ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer, if you have one.
Do not expose the fabric to excessively high temperatures (which may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it will take several minutes.
Filters are effective in different ways, and if you have any doubts, you should consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they have never seen in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, worse still, trigger allergic reactions, secrete poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals capable of causing harm or leading to human death, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and excise duties at designated points.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a significant amount, especially on goods such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmon has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often running through isolated, remote, and wooded terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than anything else.
However, strangely enough, mobile phone service is much better here than in many other parts of the route, for example, in Pennsylvania’s Wilds.
German pastries are quite good. In Bavaria, they are very plentiful and diverse, and resemble the pastries of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, apple pastries are available year-round, and cherry and plum pastries appear in the summer.
In German baking, almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts are often used. Often, popular cakes pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling flour-based confectionery, try what, depending on the region, is called oladyi or filled donuts.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the inland areas of Pakistan and North India, yogurt is actively used in curry. In South India and certain regions along the subcontinent's coast, coconut milk is typically used.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a general term applied to denote the vast diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without clarification, this term most often refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, encompasses a range of simply seasoned dishes. Javanese people particularly favor flavorings such as peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging down from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety concerns as there is a risk of the foot getting stuck.
If a horse throws its rider but the rider’s foot remains caught in the stirrup, the running horse can drag them along. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel, which have a smooth and rather thin sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English ones, are equipped with safety arches, thanks to which the leather stirrup falls from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Kochamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top, you can enjoy breathtaking mountain views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes, drawn by its huge climbing potential.
Mountain winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Downhill skiing is a major tourist destination for many ski enthusiasts (sometimes jokingly called "ski bums") who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring is also known as backcountry, ski touring, or ski hiking.
This is related, but usually doesn't involve hiking to the summit and then descending unprepared slopes, as powder skiing requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail is a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than when traveling on foot, but you will only be able to achieve such speed on cross-country skis in extremely rare cases, when you don’t have a heavy backpack and there is a prepared ski track.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through numerous countries would mean the need to apply for visas and repeatedly go through passport control.
But the Schengen Area functions as a single country in this regard.
While in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen Agreement member country separately, which will save you time and money, and also avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations, where the age boundary in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though they are younger in age than comparable mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although that is the tradition, not all members of the Sami people were engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived by fishing, hunting, and other similar trades, using reindeer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi people are employed in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Lapland.
Although the word "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive due to associations with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If there are travel advisories warning against visiting the country you plan to visit, this may affect your medical insurance during the trip or your trip cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you should also consult with governments other than your own, but their recommendations are geared towards their own citizens.
Here's one example: U.S. citizens in the Middle East may encounter situations that Europeans or Arabs do not.
The informational reports merely provide a brief description of the political situation in one country.
The expressed opinions are often superficial, vague, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information readily available.
Unfavorable meteorological conditions is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption, or leading to human casualties.
Unfavorable weather conditions occur all over the world, and they come in various forms depending on geography, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are manifestations and effects of severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to consider any risks associated with severe weather in their area, as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "security course in a hostile environment" might yield the address of a local company.
These topics are usually discussed in much greater detail in the course, often with hands-on training.
The course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing scenarios, a large amount of information on providing first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but publications about combat zones are scarce.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without a gender marker (X) or documents updated to reflect a person’s desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents varies greatly.
Inspections at checkpoints also became much more thorough after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals preparing for surgery should not expect to be able to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
A rip current is a current created by waves breaking on the shore, or sometimes on a reef or something similar.
The backflow is concentrated in several deeper areas where fast currents can form, extending to greater depths due to this type of underwater topography.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back will be no harder than usual.
Try to go where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock hits sooner than culture shock (with a shorter, more romantic period), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some habits of your native culture.
When you first went abroad, people likely treated you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding should also be shown to travelers who have returned home.
The sound and light show against the backdrop of the pyramid is one of the most interesting events in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can also see them in the silence before the show begins.
Usually, the noise of tourists and vendors is always audible. The sound and light show is like a book of stories.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819. These islands have the highest number of bases, with sixteen being operational in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers from the peninsula. The largest island is named King George Island and has the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano to this day forms an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, washed by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula here merge with the plateau, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountains, divided into two parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, that is, on the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica – the Vinson Massif, whose highest point reaches 4892 m and is called Vinson Peak.
In remote areas with no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
As a rule, a satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outdoors in direct line of sight with a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used in shipping, including for passenger and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data transmission and voice communication.
As a rule, you can get more information about connecting to this service by contacting your local telephone operator.
A increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can indeed improve your chances of getting into universities back home.
As a rule, tuition fees are charged for admission to such educational programs.
Finland is an excellent place for boating tourism. In the "land of a thousand lakes" there are also thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
When exploring archipelagos or visiting lakes, you can easily manage without a yacht.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak leave a completely different impression.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
A similar situation exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this value ranges from one to forty).
Most individual Baltic cruises include an extended stay in the Russian city of St. Petersburg.
This means that you can spend several full days in this historical city, and return to the ship for the night.
If you visit the shore only as part of a ship's excursion, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be frightening for a person of any age or social status, especially if it's their first flight ever or if they have experienced a traumatic event in the past.
There's no need to be ashamed of this: it's no different from personal dislike and fear of other things that many people have.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight can help overcome the fear that arises from the unknown or the inability to control the process.
Delivery services are well-paid for fast delivery completion. Often, the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but this has been a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they were to ship anything as air cargo, on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to deal with him faster is to send him as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, so we need your help here.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to splurge on the privilege (or – an even better option – get your company to pay for you).
However, it’s not cheap at all – from experience, a rough estimate is that you’ll pay four times more for business class and eleven times more for first class than for a standard economy ticket!
As a rule, there’s no point in even looking for discounts on business or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a substantial amount for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and therefore they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has become a victim of ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, its largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant trading center located along a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldorsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Esturoy, and it is also home to an unusual octagonal church.
At the church cemetery, there are interesting marble dove sculptures above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour and taking a walk through the unusual village.
Comparatively not far to the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, celebrated by Lord Byron and subsequently gaining worldwide fame.
Scotturb bus number 403 runs regular routes to Sintra and stops at Cape Roca.
Further north, be sure to also visit the Great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (burial site) – a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are, essentially, located on a mass grave, as well as a place that is indescribably important to a significant percentage of the Earth’s inhabitants.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, but there are even more people whose loved ones were killed here or worked to death, whether they were Jews or people of other nationalities.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and Nazis.
Do not defile this place by applying or scratching graffiti onto the surrounding objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan, as it is legally the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other public places.
Regular announcements in the subway are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if it's often just a false stereotype, the best way to succeed in Paris is to behave in the best possible way, like a “bien élevé” (well-bred) person. This will significantly ease your adaptation to the city.
The unwelcoming exterior of Parisians will vanish immediately as soon as you show a little basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily overgrown with forest, mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and represents a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a combination of microclimates, diverse soils, and elevation changes, it boasts an exceptionally wide variety of plant communities.
The area abounds with a vast number of diverse animal and bird species.
Here you can encounter rare representatives of the fauna, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, as well as many other common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women should be dressed in skirts below the knee and with covered shoulders.
In most monasteries, they provide robes to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also get them at the entrance, however this clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might be uncomfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, as well as that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on vegetables, bread, and meat (especially pork), with olive oil used extensively.
A simple and popular dish for lunch, especially in summer, is Pa-amb-oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available topping, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, meaning "You," are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is important to distinguish between verbs and complements.
This also likely simplifies reading, while writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
One should be particularly careful with the letters "c" and "g", as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, don't forget that 'r' and 'rr' are pronounced differently: *caro* means "dear" or "expensive", while *carro* means "cart" or "wagon".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this Persian grammar textbook will help you learn a lot of new things and better understand expressions.
It's obvious that if you know a language from the Romance subgroup, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and doesn't need to be learned separately.
Ancient observatories are generally considered obsolete today and serve as museums or educational institutions.
Since light pollution wasn't as much of a problem during their heyday as it is today, they are typically located in cities or on campuses that are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called "hanami," entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
This idea originated in China, where the plum blossom was a beloved flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to take even one specimen.
When visiting a formally organized garden, collecting "samples" will also result in you being expelled without a word.
Singapore is generally a very safe place that is easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arriving.
However, finding yourself in the "deep tropics"—just a few degrees north of the equator—you’ll have to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (under clear skies, less frequently).
There are also several buses going north to Hebron – a legendary site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives’ burial place.
Make sure the bus you are about to board is going to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme for holding some kind of celebration.
For example, visiting the castles in the Loire Valley and Rhine Valley, a cruise along the Danube’s highlights, or a boat trip on the Erie Canal.
They also identify routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday were also adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and those not belonging to Christianity worldwide.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake, in some open place, in order to see the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has a Christian theological explanation, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold Easter services on Saturday evening during the Easter holidays, with parishioners typically beginning the celebration of the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on these islands reached here by swimming, flying, or were carried by the current.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals could not reach there, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This presents a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be more or less dark around the clock.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and consequently, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or by title.
Harmony in the workplace is extremely important, and the results of teamwork are valued more highly than individual achievements.
Typically, employees must obtain their supervisor's permission before making any decisions and are obligated to follow the supervisor's orders without question.
