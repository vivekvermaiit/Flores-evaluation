Just as Paris now appears as the leading city of fashion in our time, people once saw Constantinople as the leading city of feudal Europe.
That place is like a huge luxury market, with over 400 items currently and adding about 1100 more items over time.
The artist created it with great skill and many colors for the adornment of holy churches, painting images like silk and beautiful objects on the walls; people desired it greatly, more than the objects crafted in the workshops of Byzantium.
It was then in that period when the fashion capital was moving from Constantinople and establishing itself in Paris.
The peak of Gothic art was between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.

Many former soldiers are suffering greatly from witnessing the horrors of war, the trauma of meeting with child soldiers who are experiencing the terrible effects of so many children who were not allowed to go to school while they were being recruited, mistreated, or exploited, or simply ignored.
They call those children "feral" to the older children. Other older children were bullying them with other people (often they would beat them); and because of jealousy, they started on that child so they could beat him to make sure he wouldn’t progress or be in a difficult situation with them.
Another group of young people mistreated them severely, and though they had many opportunities to retaliate or take revenge, they refused.
They saw others imprisoning them with animals; they say others are planning to destroy their village.
If someone raises a child with animals that aren't people, that child will have the characteristics (and the ways of doing things) that are possible with those animals they were raised with, and as a result, they may become like them or not be able to relate to people.
Sometimes, it bothers me to see people building things quickly just to finish and with little quality; the scaffolding collapses as soon as they finish building.
Begin by setting up the scaffolding, which is a single step to secure and protect people who will test things physically with a practical program or at the beginning of their work.
The scaffolding can be either visible and solid, or simply a metaphor – in other words, the instructor says it’s scaffolding, like a single trombone in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is within the application, and the work there is to support, help, or guide the way to do things that can be new for a student to do on their own.

Unfortunately, this situation causes great problems: excessive crying and sadness, inability to sleep and constant worry.
Another recent study shows that people can get enough protein from plants and legumes, but it’s very expensive for primates like us to digest it again and again.
However, insects like ants (fourmis, termites, maki) are a good source of fat and oil, but they contain a lot of protein which is in many nutritious foods.

The practice of Tibetan Buddhism is rooted in the teachings of the Buddha, but it incorporates Mahayana practices of the path of love and incorporates subtle energies within the Yoga of India.
