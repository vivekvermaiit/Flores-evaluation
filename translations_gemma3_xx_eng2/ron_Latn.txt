In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a reference, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee and acknowledges the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and of the sport they practice, are better served by implementing significant changes within our organization than by withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports the conducting of an independent investigation, which can shed light on how abuses of the magnitude so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s victims were able to go unnoticed for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make artistic gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe environment with a positive and supportive atmosphere.

This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs were covered in feathers, a hypothesis already widely circulated, but also offers details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was dark brown on the upperparts, with a lighter or orange hue on the underparts.
The discovery also offers insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft, called a rachis, but exhibit other characteristic elements of feathers – barbs and barbules – researchers have concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that arose after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not downy fluff.
Researchers have suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a hatchling.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over 20 people.

They discovered that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system has been proven to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be regarding magnetic reversals.

The Iraq study group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
It warns that no one can guarantee at this time that any intervention in Iraq will stop the sectarian war, the escalating violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report opens with a plea for open debate and consensus-building in the United States regarding policy toward the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of nearly every aspect of the current executive’s policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first recommendation out of the 78 he made was to launch a new diplomatic initiative before the end of this year with the aim of securing Iraq’s borders against hostile interventions and restoring diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by the tidal forces produced between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have succeeded in concluding that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of halo and is composed of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very disturbing and worrying due to the very high mortality rate."
Doctor Moll suggests it’s possible some patients contracted the virus in the hospital, and at least 2 were hospital staff members.
Over the course of a year, one infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine were also promised by the government, which will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to historically most affected areas have been delayed this year due to insufficient funding and lower prioritization compared to other diseases.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where, three years later, he began working for the Swedish Post Office, eventually becoming its chief engraver.
He produced over 1000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.

All the entrances to the caves, which have been named "The Seven Sisters," have a diameter between 100 and 250 meters (328 - 820 feet).
Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn’t as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that these represent deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeologic Team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a somewhat technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, they place the ballot envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting and that no ballots are added, except for those of counted and properly authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The first event he participated in was the slalom, where he didn't finish on his first run. 36 out of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In the other competition she participated in, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the seated women's category, with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-place finisher, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place competitor, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female seated cross-country skiers failed to finish their lap, and 45 out of a total of 117 giant slalom skiers did not qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy General Inspector D. K. Arya stated: “We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The accusations are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused of murdering her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She has been detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be compromised as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for criminal prosecution, informed journalists that it will not make any further comments at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants drawn based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that, following the signing of the agreement, it have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence for only five years.
The hunters who participated in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by foresters, with the test itself being monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters’ Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited based on the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director for Conservation and Heritage of the Park at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety briefing and training.
Martelly took the oath of office yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), comprised of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEC as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating iPods malfunctioning have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple reported another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company said were “not serious.”
The Ministry responded, saying that Apple's delay is "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported no damage across the islands.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She completed studies in obstetrics and in 1959 began working for Auckland National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm labor in his free time.
Her research demonstrated that, if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders, known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid their tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of the two moons. A unique moment, just like she was. A strong woman.”
Dustin Runnels, also known as "Golddust," commented that "The Moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated, throughout the 2010 federal election campaign, that in her opinion, Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those surveyed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as in three relay events, however his physical condition has been called into question due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to control the pain, as it was prohibited during the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill into law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as “political chatter and nonsense.”
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology based on the use of satellites, unlike older systems based on ground radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and transmit more precise information to pilots.
No further transport options are available, overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and park and ride facilities are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation brought up the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without the team's fans present.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of designs. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. An indicator can be prepared using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (given that hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball out of them.
Moisture present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which may give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which were used communally by both men and women.
When you call someone thousands of kilometers away, you do so through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
A huge, 100-foot-tall rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel gave us was much simpler and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport brought us.
Beneath them, we have several medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small felines (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat far more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their key to success is the niche concept; each feline has its own role to fulfill, so it doesn’t compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called prides.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to wolf packs or dog packs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t resemble the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather a proposition of sharp words, shouted.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing the ground to locate them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment, then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population it originated from (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The initial population hasn't changed at all; it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, and as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look increasingly dissimilar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and represents a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (that is, release from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. Additionally, they provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, fearing nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws held over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with a supplementary set in the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that crossed its path escaped unscathed.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaur species, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex wouldn't have been able to handle it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to hold banquets where they reclined on one side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include dishes that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to respond to the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, as part of temples, towers in the shape of pyramids called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower served as the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
The largest part of a Jewish family’s life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just counters opening directly onto the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely colonized. Scandinavian sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
However, regardless of the discoveries he made, Eskimo tribes already lived in those places at that time.
Although all were considered "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences regarding the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might believe a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, one can read the words: “Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776”. The text appears inverted, at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is still known that, in its early days, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was kept rolled up.
Therefore, the marking was likely made simply for labeling.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was led by the French “of Vichy.” These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being named "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, American forces alongside the Free French liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state; it also, in a way, defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, as there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on the state governments, often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
Also, it did not have the authority to invalidate laws and tax rates between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government with such leniency that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, are tied for second place in the ranking of the most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Among popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in Nordic regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan, there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 6th largest island country in the world! **Note:** The original Romanian states 7th largest *island*, but it's more accurate and commonly understood as 6th largest *island country*. I've made that adjustment for clarity in English. If you strictly want a literal translation, please specify.
Due to the island groups that Japan possesses, it is often said that Japan is, geographically speaking, an "archipelago."
Taiwan’s beginnings date back a long time, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to get a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but, more importantly, its proportions have been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format, somewhat confusingly, is actually 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this proportion.
The rule of thirds, often misused and frequently ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion for creating dynamism while still maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to one another, despite differences in language and customs.
Her omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether the principle was truly being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian provisions, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law provisions, enshrined in numerous international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany anticipated a similar reaction in the case of its unrestrained submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from his former boss, Charles Batchelor, addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demarcating different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, the periods between successive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best-known such interval was the Three Kingdoms period, spanning 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to seize the throne in the magnificent palace at Xi’an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Additionally, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to achieve success.
Similarly, in the case of soldiers, because instead of a military hierarchy based on class, they now based it on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that transcended the worldly. He often went to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira," located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, having survived throughout time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s hard to find even when you know it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be glimpsed or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of numerous large pyramidal structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the “Giza Necropolis,” located in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), numerous smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The “upstroke” marking looks like a V, and the “downstroke” marking looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you need to start from the tip and push the bow; down means you need to start from the frog (that is, the part you grip the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to mark your own fingerings, but remember that the printed fingerings for bowings are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age four), and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of market women to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the eyes of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that encompasses the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a logic inherent to, and associated with, scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely independent of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which drives the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures arose connected to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silk and spices more valued than what the markets of Byzantium offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles from the West can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advancements of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is farming done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often ecological, that uses saved seeds originating from the same ecological region, alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar mindsets who feel marginalized by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, including fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called “feral” or wild. Some feral children have been sequestered by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents, because of severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.
It is possible that feral children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; and it is said that others lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within their physical limitations) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should simplify and make learning more engaging, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding or workshop method is not a learning method in itself, but rather a support that assists people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the paperclip man from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, serving to query, offer clues, and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complex for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for numerous reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extending to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they lack food, love, and education, but there are.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe housing, caring foster parents, a solid education, and reliable healthcare.
Family care is expected to cover the needs of the children, which were not met in the home they had previously been in.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet introduce additional dimensions regarding the approach to types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, the facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
In his work, “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause the direction of variation in each generation to be dominated by one or the other of the two genetic pools.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us if they aren't cooked.
Unlike these, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, we shouldn’t be surprised if our ancestors solved the “protein problem” in a way similar to chimpanzees in today’s savannas.
Sleep interruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get up from bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is one's own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energetic channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the estrangement of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and would be fought seriously, by “delegated” armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became useless almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union were deployed, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transportation of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people across the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
One of the more notable recent examples in this regard was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in occupying Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near their homes to have easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, usually under the care of goatherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonway-type roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the somewhat more uneven roads of the time.
The crossties were introduced quite early, to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, however, the iron led to the faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known mode of transport was walking; people began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Evidence of bipedalism appears in 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked upright seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is evident that the world has changed greatly as a result of scientific and technological advancements, and problems are now larger due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
Following its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few streets away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as “Dunlap posters.”
On July 8th, the first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the earliest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds, many characteristics similar to dinosaurs can still be seen.
They have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically, all computers used today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and the name for these digits is binary digits or bits, in computer science jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best clue for internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions specific to that poison.
The term "gândac" (beetle) is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the old comparison with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to life within the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is not in their best interest, nor in the child’s.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In the event of an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one; experimentation and an experiment represent a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers primarily used classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects related to science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which do not represent simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment represented one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments, labeling either the bacteriophage’s DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in any other part of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Organized tourism centered around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing, and learning more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave by car from small rural settlements, heading towards their workplaces, passing by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter system, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this heavily carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of dissatisfaction regarding water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely encountered.
Why do transport systems give rise to such dissatisfaction, why do they fail day after day? Is it perhaps because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, as drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows also tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
These days, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite—namely, that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in the technical mastery of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known some fundamental chemical elements since antiquity, such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory according to which everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: water, earth, air, and fire.
It more closely resembled the four states of matter – solid, liquid, gas, and plasma – in that order, although he theorized that it transformed into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing tools emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to pick up a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer appears.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a small impulse or without any impulse at all.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of approximately 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in higher relief areas.
There may be more magma closer to the surface, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into maturity.
These theories study what drives some people to want to do what they do and what in their environment might cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories regarding content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme consists of trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, people transform into unrecognizable individuals who believe they must change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the physical group they belong to.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) also represents a unique component of a virtual team.
“The invisible team” is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently within the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Consequently, the process by which an organization works cohesively to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for satisfying customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology represent physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. As such, it allows for narrowing the scope of research and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, but have also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would enjoy taking their students to places where a bus trip isn’t possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while remaining in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; each year the site is redesigned, and previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student’s written expression. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, having an audience generally has the effect of changing that.
Given that students often represent the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
Additionally, blogging “forces students to be more aware of the world around them.” The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
“The appropriate use of blogs “can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others have written, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues” (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, offering a range of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka district and much more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider to be quintessentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that might surprise many: the number of African Americans living in the US is larger than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coasts of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but don't let it look expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be assertive when rejecting a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, being known as Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it calling it Casa Branca (White House), but abandoned it again in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a lot of all sorts of knick-knacks, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the town's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a relatively safe place, visiting areas outside the city requires careful information gathering to understand the current state of the fighting still ongoing in the North Kivu province.
The town is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and offers some of the cheapest gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Alongside its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, faraway places.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction and having an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates’s PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in the country, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s national parks.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island and is the place many tourists see as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to Hong Kong’s skyline has been likened to a radiant bar chart, highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
To experience the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is crowded onto reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British colonizers appropriated, and therefore, for anyone seeking evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not, however, merely mangrove swamps – they also encompass some of the last strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/wetland.
Starting in 1966, the Sundarbans became a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar / Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since buses connecting the districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pylons rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The underpass clearance beneath the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn’t opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important group of indigenous people who inhabited what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Gigantic Province of the Indies," emerged in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has, with effort, preserved much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is taking place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set as equivalent to 1 Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds will generally be accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will likely accept British and American currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside of the country, so you need to exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently exceed 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived cold feel more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't particularly “rainy” or “dry” seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it’s best to give them their space.
In addition to this, be careful that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strongly scented foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sadly remembered naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is located between two harbors. The most famous of these are found in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most of them have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide range of shops arranged along the shore. It is safe to swim.
The main local beer is “Number One”; it’s not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
You can find many French wines, but New Zealand or Australian ones would pair better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you have concerns you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino comes brimming with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian quality standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the authorities’ advice, respect all signs, and pay increased attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be encountered outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance offers peace of mind to the traveler that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that, although the music on the main stages has ended, there may be areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the cabin's location, as navigating through ice creates an unbearable noise for those who are sensitive.
Cruises from St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time customers spend there and the money they spend. Usually, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the atmosphere lively and encourage guests to stay longer.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay clear-headed.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is reduced and you can't drive as you would on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short time, enough snow can fall to block you in.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation, or by ice forming on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic generally flows uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safari tours are likely the main tourist attraction of Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word "safari," as it is commonly used, refers to overland journeys undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those found in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good visibility of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "safari hike", or "on foot") consists of hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March, cancellation policies for coronavirus reasons did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with regular tickets costing around 7000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you don’t have an iron available, or if you don’t like wearing ironed socks, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters differ in their level of efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider the option of buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with back home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation, or, in severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force, are generally not considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping in certain locations offers you the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers planning to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging traffic conditions along the entire Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often running through remote and undeveloped areas.
If you're used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves are prevalent.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to observe them strictly.
However, rather bizarrely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Often, popular pastries go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastry products, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be “dry” or “liquid” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without further qualification, however, the term tends to refer to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a range of simply spiced dishes, with peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices being the predominant flavors preferred by Javanese people.
The stirrups support the rider’s feet, hanging down on either side of the saddle.
These offer the rider better stability, but can pose safety issues, as a rider’s feet may become trapped in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle but remains with one foot caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along when it bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of precautionary measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley – the most sought-after climbing spot in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of high granite walls and peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits. Climbers from all over the world continuously forge new routes among the walls with unlimited potential.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of gliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called “ski bums” in English, who organize entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing, also known as ski touring or ski mountaineering, involves hiking with skis and a backpack.
It’s a related activity, but one that doesn’t usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering competitions, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking – but you will rarely achieve speeds typical of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack, on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, traveling through multiple countries would mean repeatedly going through visa application procedures and passport control.
In this regard, the Schengen Area is organized in a way similar to a single country.
As long as you remain in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to do so at passport control points.
Similarly, someone with a Schengen visa does not need to obtain a visa for each Schengen member country individually, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn’t a universal definition establishing which produced items are antiques. Some tax agencies consider goods over 100 years old to be antiques.
The definition varies depending on geographical location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and the culture related to trade is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami area.
Despite being widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "țigan" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and a misperception of the Roma population.
If the country you are planning to visit is subject to a travel warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
One example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented superficially, generally, and too simplistically, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
“Extreme weather conditions” is a generic term used for any type of dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in many forms, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and uncontrolled wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climate phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in the area, as they could disrupt their travel plans.
It is advisable that anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for "hostile environment course" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through hands-on experience.
A course will typically last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are quite a few books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival, but publications addressing war zones are scarce.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid travel documents for the return journey.
Governments’ openness to issuing passports that do not declare sex (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents are the flow of water returning to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast current towards the deep waters can form there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once you get past the current, swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to move to a position where you won’t get caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone saw you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests more quickly than culture shock (it lasts less from the honeymoon phase), is longer in duration, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapted to a new culture sometimes face particular difficulties when readjusting to their native culture.
If you were to return home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of your customs from your native culture.
When you had barely left for abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country involves an adaptation process.
The world doesn't always expect patience and understanding to be shown towards travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, the noise made by tourists and vendors is constantly heard. The sound and light show seems taken from a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are displayed on pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple countries and have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the peninsula converge to create this plateau, then diverge again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, known as the Sentinel Range, lie the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In isolated locations, without cell phone signal, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot replace a cell phone, as you need to be outdoors, with an unobstructed view of the satellite, in order to make a call.
The service is widely used in maritime transport, including by recreational boats, as well as by expeditions requiring remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local phone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning a gap year is to combine travel with study.
It’s a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before attending university, without jeopardizing their educational path, however.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for rowing. “The Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore for excursions from a ship, you won’t need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is in no way near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
There’s nothing to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and dislikes towards other things, which manifest in many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is critical when it comes to documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to download and clear customs.
The only way to get him through faster was to send him as checked baggage. Airline regulations won’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
However, it isn't cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times more for first class!
Generally, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the eastern zone of Moldova, which has its own government and its own currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed, and modern commercial center, located around an enormous gulf and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, alongside glass-facaded buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional red-tiled roofs dating back to the 18th century, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city possesses an atmosphere that more closely resembles the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour wandering through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which gained fame beyond the country's borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus runs regular services to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the northern part, you can also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of Saint Mary.
Please be aware that, in essence, you are visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
Many men and women who survived internment there are still alive, and far more who had family members killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the area by drawing or scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only made in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, alongside other services.
The regular announcements on the subway are made only in Catalan, however, unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although it’s often just a stereotype that doesn’t align with reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it’s good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). It will help you get by with much more ease.
The Parisians' reserved attitude quickly turns friendly if you demonstrate a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, fir, and spruce, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types, and altitude levels.
The region also boasts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and western capercaillie can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer headscarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you’ll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes aren't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used generously.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available seasonings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even within a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also, undoubtedly, makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters you need to pay more attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Obviously, someone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution wasn't as big of a problem during their heyday, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants never look better than in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to pick even "just one" of them.
If you visit a formally landscaped garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place where you can easily get around and buy almost anything as soon as you arrive.
But being located in the “upper tropics,” just a few degrees north of the equator, you will face both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when it’s clear, which is less frequent).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried, along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions relating to this holiday have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the islands' remoteness from the mainland, mammals failed to make the journey, resulting in the giant tortoise being the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit areas in the Arctic or Antarctica during winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be, more or less, dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard attire in the business environment, and colleagues address each other using last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is essential, with emphasis placed on teamwork rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain approval from their superiors for all the decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
