At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC television shopping channel.
He also filed a lawsuit against a rival security company, ADT Corporation.
Even if an experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing Ebola mortality, so far no medicine has clearly demonstrated being suitable to treat existing infection.
A dose of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed good results in the field, but formal studies showed it had less benefit than desired for preventing death.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning the scientists used it as a reference point to compare three other treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that the interests of our athletes and teams, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with a significant change within our organization rather than a demotion.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuses described with such courage by survivors of Larry Nassar were not discovered for so long and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOPC share the same goal: to make the sport of gymnastics, and others, as safe as possible for athletes so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and autonomous environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor, and then in the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details that fossils usually don’t, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown at the top with a pale carrot color below.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics like barbs and barbules, scholars have thought that the rachis was probably a subsequent evolutionary development compared to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying but rather to regulate temperature or to display themselves. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scholars have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows features of an adult and not the plumage of a chick.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning and it killed two police officers and injured more than twenty people.

I discovered that the Sun worked on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity and rotation, and that’s it.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to magnetic inversions.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop the war between factions, the ever-increasing violence, or end in a mess.
The resolution began by calling for a sincere discussion and the formation of consensus in the United States on policy toward the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost all aspects of the Executive’s current policy towards Iraq and states that a change of direction is immediately needed.
The first of 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative must be taken before the end of the year to secure the borders of Iraq against hostile interventions and to restart diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the Earth causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory says that a large part of dark matter is found around a galaxy like a halo, and is made up of many small particles.
The news on television shows white smoke coming from the factory.
Local authorities are advising residents near the factory to stay indoors, close their air conditioning, and not drink water from the tap.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was “really very problematic and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.”
Doctor Moll thinks that some patients might have caught the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two were hospital nurses.
Within a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems low: 6000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that used to send sediment throughout the river were stopped.
The sediments were necessary to create sandbanks and beaches that served as habitat for animals.
The result was that two species of fish have become extinct and another two are at risk, like the gobioid goby.
Even if the water level rises only a few meters after the flooding, officials hope it will be enough to restore the sandbanks eroded by the tide.

“Its thermal behavior is not stable like in the large caves of the Earth which often maintain a constant temperature, but it is in line with these large holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has usually been a rather low-tech experience: voters go into a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferred candidate into an envelope.
After the poll workers verify the identity of the voter, the elector puts the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no ballots present at the start of voting and that no ballots are added other than those of voters who have been duly counted and authorized.
The candidates may send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict control following specific procedures.

In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers in the group did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 total female skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen computer and mobile phone.
The chief inspector D.K. Arya said, “We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her telephone and computer.”
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a while while the rescuers pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
She was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he/she was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, he was in the Sheriff of Edinburgh's court accused of having killed his son.
She is in custody awaiting trial and proceedings, but any testimonial evidence could be compromised because her image has been made so public.
This is something that happens often in the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and the courts have seen that publishing photos can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says “journalists seem to be walking on a dangerous path by publishing photos and so on of suspects.”
The Office of the Public Prosecutor, which is generally responsible for the proceedings, told journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
According to leaked news, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
As far as other topics are concerned, what was discussed was the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is requesting a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees that this presence should only be for five years.
Those who participated in the supplementary disinfection test had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NSW Police & Wildlife Service, the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. has recruited qualified volunteers under the Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received safety instructions and complete training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine people.
It's the fifth time Martelly has been elected in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous election authority as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, arose from the fact that there haven't been any elections, some of which should have been held as far back as 2011.
They have reported around 60 cases of malfunctioning, overheating iPods, which have caused fires with four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan has said that it is aware of 27 incidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI said that Apple had been informed of another 34 overheating incidents that the company defined as “not serious.”
The ministry responded saying that Apple’s delay with the report is “truly regrettable”.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT).
The emergency office of North Marianne said there was no damage in the nation.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been saved and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
The hostages, including children and elderly people, have been released today along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who urgently needed the restroom. Mendoza was murdered.
He followed in his father’s footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be a lift operator and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, she started studying premature birth in her free time.
The research has shown that if a hormone were given, it would delay the maturation of the child's lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators have recovered two flight recorders – “black boxes”.
Even the fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A truly unique thing, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels commented saying that “Luna was crazy like me…maybe even more so…I love her and I miss her…let’s hope she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who do not want Australia to be a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll agree with this idea and want Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal hopeful was expected to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her health has been called into question.
He wasn't able to take the medicines to overcome his pain because they are forbidden by the Judges.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at Central Missouri University, found the largest known prime number on January 25th.
So many people have monitored the leak using various tools and programs since the beginning of February, and it was communicated on Tuesday.
Comets could have brought water to Earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how the Earth was formed, given that comets hit the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
By the way, they’ve said that you are “jokes and political maneuvers.”
He decided to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly with shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
It utilizes a satellite technology different from the old radar-based technology on the ground, which allows air traffic controllers to pinpoint aircraft with more precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extraordinary transport has been put into operation and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and the car park and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The few available transport options have brought to light the possibility that the match might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A recent study published in the journal Science deals with the birth of a new species of finch on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have stated that the new species evolved in only two generations, although it is thought that this process lasted much longer, due to crosses between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch migrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn like a fine thread that can be twisted and crushed. It can be beaten or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and applied to other metals. It could be made this way to the point that it was sometimes used to decorate the handmade figures in books called “illuminated manuscripts”.
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by how many hydrogen ions (the H of pH) there are in the substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since a hydrogen atom is made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the flour and the yeast together, then with clean, wet hands, knead to make a loaf.
The dampness will likely react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a sort of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost all houses connected to a complex sewage system.
The remains of drains were found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets even in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the buildings of public baths where men and women went together, mixed up.
When someone calls you from very far away, you have to use a satellite phone.
The satellite in space picks up the call and sends it down almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light a little and our vision.
They need a really big rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us has been to give us a more comfortable and faster means of transport.
He brought the train, the automobile, and many other means of transport.
Among the laurels there are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including house cats) that eat many even smaller animals such as insects, mice, shrews, and birds.
The secret to its success is the concept of the niche, a special place that every cat has and that keeps it away from competition with others.
Lions are the most social of the felines; they live in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, they are a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides are a bit like packs of wolves or dogs, animals incredibly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, make great leaps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is of the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the powerful one of the lion, but more like a string of harsh, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, lizards, mice, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists think the ocelot follows and finds animals to eat (prey) with its sense of smell, sensing underground where they have been.
Owls see very well in the dark with night vision, and they move even in silence. The ocelot hunts its prey by camouflaging itself with the environment and then jumping on its back.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move beyond a mountain or a river, or move to a new island in such a way that they are no longer able to easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has many resources and many competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they need the same adjustments as before.
As time goes on while the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to resemble less and less any other population.
Finally, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
Let's call this process speciation, which in practice means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale (or, put out).
Plants nourish themselves from the sun with photosynthesis. And they also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants, and we make our clothes with plants. A large part of what we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot live.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time, it wasn't afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
In its mouth it had more than 70 teeth, sharp as razors, and another one was on the palate – there was no escape for whoever was caught.
We aren't sure, but it could be that it had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, fish, other mosasaurs, and was perhaps also cannibalistic.
It gets stuck with everything that goes into the water; even a beast like a T.rex would have had a bad end.
Even if many of their foods might seem normal, the Romans had a few strange or unusual items like wild boar, peacock, lampreys and a kind of broth called ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, the gentlemen held banquets together, reclining on their side while eating.
The dining of the ancient Romans couldn't have had the foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries after.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, coconut, and no ancient Roman ever ate tacos.
The Babylonians, for all their gods, built a primary temple which was the house of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the gods’ needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priest could enter.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids called ziggurats were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house wasn’t so important.
A large part of the life of a Jewish family was outside.
The women were preparing food in the courtyard; the shops were only stalls along the street. The houses were made of stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, which is why wood was so expensive.
In Greenland, few people lived. Long ago, the Norwegian Erik the Red was sent into exile from Iceland because he had killed someone, and while going west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even if he made his discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even though every country was ‘Scandinavian’, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the film National Treasure, you might think there’s a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776” were written. These words can be seen at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Even if no one knows who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be put away.
So it's likely that this note was added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
He governed from Vichy France. These were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies had invaded the south of France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
By the summer of 1944, the Americans and the forces of Free France had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared among a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, in relation to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas* which means city or city-state, and which in some way defined the greatness of society.
City-states are ancestors of nations. A culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through various generations, a lasting cultural imprint and a just diffusion [of that knowledge].
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical traces and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially had formed a weak central government, with the Congress as its only component, under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to demand taxes and, since there was no executive or national judiciary, to enforce all its laws it relied on state authorities which often did not cooperate.
He didn't even have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before being amended, and the states accepted the central government with such lightness that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the German national football team, the second team in the world to have won the most titles and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, handball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are famous, especially in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest being Honshu) which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the groups of islands that it has, Japan is often geographically called an “archipelago.”
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors called the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Company of the Indies Orientale established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan, beginning to alter the indigenous practices of grain production and employing Chinese laborers in rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part and the northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they once looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues still today.
For example, the most common photographic format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was the quintessential film format at the end of the analog film era.
It doesn't matter anymore, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio was inherited from the formats of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format group) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often-criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
She says the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held together the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His power seized everyone, from kings to the poor.
One of the main doctrines of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate hardship and misery, and that the Church’s money is there for this purpose.
The control center of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and all this power and these riches made many wonder if doctrine had been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, the English imposed a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy succeeded by cutting off essential civilian and military support, even though this blockade was a violation of an internationally accepted and codified law through many international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain has placed sea mines in international waters to block entire parts of the ocean to all ships, causing damage even to neutral vessels.
Since there was little to do against this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of almost all citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid another similar thing in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to work with the Edison company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without a penny, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the various periods of the year: each phase of China or each family that was in command was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was a somewhat troubled period with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, there were terrible wars between the various nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest position in the grand palace at Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the decimal metric system, the passage from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution and the occupation, the military careers were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of classifying the army by class, it was based on caliber from this point on.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous as his "Hira'" mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The very same cave, surviving through the ages, offers a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it wasn't easy to find at all, even though everyone knew it existed. Once inside the cave, there’s total isolation.
One can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or felt from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" facing the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, has many pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the most imposing), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The sign for "high arch" looks like a V, and the sign for "low arch" like a small letter 'g' or a square without the bottom side.
They'll tell you to start from the tip and pull the bow, and that already means you should start from the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
A high bow typically produces a softer sound, while a low bow typically produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that the ink markings are there for a musical reason and should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Thérèse, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age four) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, on October 6, 1789, at Versailles were forced by a crowd of market women to return to Paris.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and sending threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At a certain point, someone from the crowd showed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The costs of the war of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the majority of expenses and interest on bonds exchanged in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would have constituted the fundamental conquests of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that encouraged the creation of the order.
The period in which these events unfolded is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The middle period of the Middle Ages came after the first phase of the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism has many ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative to the strict sense that the human destiny is guided by a basic logic together with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: the development of technology itself follows a path independent of cultural or political influence, and conversely, technology has its own “effects” on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car engine leads to the development of roads, by force.
However, a network of national roads isn't economically viable just for a few cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Having so many cars also leads to many accidents on our roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures linked to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with society, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris today is known as the capital of fashion, Constantinople was the capital of fashion of feudal Europe.
It is known for having been a luxury center from the 1400s to the 1100s.
Its value had fallen in the twelfth century, above all because the Crusaders returned with gold and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It’s in this period that the title of Capital of Luxury passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the wardrobe was strongly influenced by the Byzantine Eastern culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles would likely remain behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons on their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses original saved seeds from the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who think alike, who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished according to the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of the members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or generated by a specific combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signaled their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to the few unfortunate cases of children who, through negligence, abandonment, or intentional abuse, were not supported in their social development by adults during their upbringing.
These castrated males are commonly called “selvareghi”. Some of them were placed within boundaries by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the young male was due to the parents’ rejection of a serious intellectual or physical deficiency in the castrated animal.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or before escaping.
If you think others are being raised by animals; he says that some lived in the wild.
When raised completely away from non-human animals, the child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised him, such as its fearfulness or its indifference towards humans.
While learning should be based on projects to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
What is often referred to as scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people who are facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The tools called scaffolds can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little man in Microsoft Office’s clip art.
The virtual scaffolding is built into the software and its purpose is to question, suggest, and explain procedures that could be difficult for a single student to manage.
The children are given into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn't supportive, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safety net for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster family should provide everything that is missing from the home from which the children were previously taken.
The internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
And the distinct characteristics of the Internet have brought other dimensions to uses and approaches to gratification.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” have been identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated web site audience reactions.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can understand if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess someone's sincerity.
He suggested, perhaps, that these abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals like dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation forward and backward between the two pools at each generation.
Nutritional sustenance is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one, to satisfy its need for amino acids by finding them within available plant resources.
Furthermore, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant resources most easily accessible would have been the proteins in their leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large quantity of protein which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be too surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees of the savannah still do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during the normal sleep time and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you back to a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you tend to rearrange the bedside table while you sleep, it might end up on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve consuming many liquids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleeping, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is correlated to the amount of tension present in the body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person possesses the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone is heading towards enlightenment. The only thing hindering this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended through the path of Mahayana love and through many techniques typical of Indian yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of global love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the yoga postures themselves, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment takes shape.
Germany was a common enemy before World War II, leading the USSR and the United States to collaborate. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures caused the decline of nations.
Twenty years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
She would have continued for the next 40 years and would have truly been fought over by the commanding armies and her battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed and the only hope remaining was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans had already become outdated almost from one day to the next when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union formed fronts on the Belarusian and Ukrainian territories after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Equipping ships to transport goods has long been the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of navies has traditionally been that of ensuring the nation maintained the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the enemy’s ability to move their people and goods.
One of the recent examples of this stuff worth noting was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would probably have been able to conquer England as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goat was first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Cattle pens were usually dug in clearings that went around hills or other grazing areas, often overseen by goatherds who were often boys and youths, similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
The wagons were already being built in England in the 16th century.
Even though the wagons were only a few wooden planks put together haphazardly, they allowed the horses pulling them to go faster and haul heavier loads compared to the completely ruined roads of the time.
The sleepers were laid down almost immediately to hold the rails in position. But a while later it became clear that the rails would have been better with an iron bar on top.
This has become common practice, but the iron dissolved and the wooden wheels of the wagons creaked.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway had been built.
The first means of transport was feet; humans began to walk on two legs two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means ‘man on foot’).
Those who were there before, the Australopithecines, usually didn't walk upright.
The bipedal trait has been found in fossils of australopithecines dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living better together with the environment, we can join environmental movements and we can also become more active in trying to lessen future suffering.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, now we need to find the cause of the problems and solve them.
It’s quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become even bigger due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten and signed copy by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was soon sent to the printer John Dunlap, who was located a few isolated miles away.
During the night, they made between 150 and 200 copies of what are known as "Dunlap flyers."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy ended up in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe a group of dinosaurs were saved and are still alive today. We call them birds.
So many people don’t think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number only has two possible values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated with binary digits, or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine box or toxic chemical products around the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
This term is used by entomologists in a formal way for this group of insects.
It stems from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects adapted to infest humans.
The winter rooms and the rooms for guests are small, they are suitable for living in the attic or in the guest house.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have seen that women have twice the possibility of getting MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their interest, or in the child's interest.
These couples might decide to try to adopt a child.
The rights of natural parents end in such a way that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides almost all scientific discoveries.
However, it’s not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, also guiding questions and observations lead scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers were focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
He accepted Aristotle's ideas on all scientific subjects, including psychology.
Once the knowledge of Greek began to decline, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots stemming from Greece.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production with biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a free cycle period even without external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
I did two experiments labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on its nature appeals to people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and get to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave by car from the villages in the countryside to go to work and are overtaken by others who are going to work where they have just left.
In this transport system, everyone is somehow connected and supports a system based on private cars.
Science says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the means of transport. Almost everyone complains about the means of transport.
In developed countries, it’s rare to hear complaints similar to those about water quality or about collapsing bridges.
Why do means of transport cause so many complaints, why do they have problems every day? Don't the transport engineers understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with total certainty.
Fortunately, those who drive tend to stay within a reasonably consistent limit; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, three relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships give a hand in planning, designing and in the functioning of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their hind wings over their body.
This gives it the ability to hide from predators in many small places.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some thought it made sense, but others thought the opposite, that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and also other stars).
This seems like a sensible thing to say, because it doesn’t seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river; in some places it is six thousand meters wide.
A good 20 percent of the river water that ends up in the world's oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in size or in the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by almost everyone who works in the state, while Latin is often used in royal ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, because these could be found in nature in authentic form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
And alloys are practically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like gold and silver.
It’s also worth noting that they have a small quantity of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil has been a good friend to many people since it came out.
Unfortunately, with the arrival of newer ways of writing, the pencil has ended up being put aside and is used less and less.
People now send messages on computer screens, they don't need a pencil sharpener anymore.
One could wonder what will become of the keyboard once something even newer comes out.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It feels a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Nuclear fission releases a part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little or no prompting.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
There could be seas on the near side because the crust is thinner there. It was easier for the lava to come out onto the surface.
The theories of content are centered on the research of what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized becoming adults.
These theories look at what there is in certain people that makes them desire the things they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
The most famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
From the other side of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they have to change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
That kind of behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a normal team because their teams can find themselves across different time zones that might not be understood by local administration.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the administration team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? Innovation is an objective for putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to serve the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) states that the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The neurological data provides physical proof for a theoretical strategy to his investigation of knowledge. Consequently, it narrows the area of investigation and makes it all the more precise.
The correlation between cervical pathology and behavior supports the scientists in this research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors have an effect on behavior and cause changes to certain mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This provides so much information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Even if Artificial Intelligence has something of a fantastical nature, it is a very important part of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation within a machine.
The study of AI concerns the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
The examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and also to recognize handwriting, voice and face.
These subjects have become separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems today are often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military field, given that they have been implemented in many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are a very important thing for every class. Many times, the teacher would like to take their students to places where it's not possible to go by bus.
Technology offers them a solution with virtual tours. Students can view the works of a museum, visit an aquarium, or watch art while seated in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redone, but the old versions are kept online like a scrapbook.
Even blogs can help students write better. While students often begin their blog experience with grammatical errors and misspelled words, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, whoever writes the blog strives to write better and avoid criticism.
Holding a blog, according to [the source], “encourages students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them.” The need to fuel public interest inspires students to be more skilled and engaging (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the normal school day.
A frequent use of blogs is to encourage students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to online materials, students can define their own positions in the context of what others write, in addition to describing their personal perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful and bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south there are Niagara Falls and to the north there is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things, and even more, make Ontario seem like the quintessence of Canada, according to those who come from outside.
Many areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited natural areas.
A comparison of populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and as far as wildlife is concerned, it’s a continent unto itself.
A large part of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought their lands and also Islam, which has especially succeeded in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influenza and European colonialism began in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovering the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: better than all the women who travel claim to be married, whether it's true or not.
It's better to wear a ring too (as long as it's not a cheap-looking thing).
Women need to understand that cultural differences might be what they think is harassment, and it’s not strange to be followed, touched, grabbed by the arm, etcetera.
You must be resolute in telling men no, and not be afraid to assert your reasons (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids.
The Portuguese dismantled and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city, originally called Daru I-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish traders who had established a trading base here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco for going shopping.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of trinkets, but it's all stuff for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned most of the city's roads, particularly in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any other travel outside of Goma must be prepared with an understanding of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and some of the gorilla-spotting expeditions barely made it back from Africa.
You need to find a boda-boda (mototaxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Along with the fact that it is relatively difficult to reach, “Timbuktu” has become a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
She is one of the key contributors to the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in strong contrast with other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic than African charm.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting various wild animals.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like in all National Parks of South Africa, there are daily entrance and conservation fees.
It might be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry into a selection of parks in South Africa or all of the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place most visited by tourists.
The series of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shining bar graph, recognizable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, go to the island and then to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
A large part of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is built on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the place the British colonizers wanted to take for themselves, and so if you want to see something of the colonial past of this territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching for 80 kilometers (30 miles) across the territory of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also contain what remains of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which a third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and an estimate says that now in the area there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, particularly those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since interdistrict buses are often full, it's better to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many routes are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transport for going to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a long bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes each 3.50 meters wide.
The headroom under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, with the Brazilian customs control points completed.
The Guarani were the most significant ethnic group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, surviving by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called “the gigantic province of the Indies”, was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Founded in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
If there are tournaments and games also in other parts of the year, too.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, take a look at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed as equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The checks need to be cashed at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currency might be okay; check with the person concerned in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It’s almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it was summer there when it was winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months temperatures above 30 degrees are common.
This winter the heat has been disappointingly mild; the temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel much colder than the thermometer says.
There haven't been particularly “rainy” or “dry” seasons; the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's mammals are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from any other wild animal!
No matter how gentle they seem, the bison, the deer, and the fox, the bears and any other large animal, he will attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don’t keep an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their space.
In the mountains, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly foods and keep the base camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of approximately 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval station in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to enter the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British ocean liner. Approximately 200 American and German vessels were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the small town resulted in the murder of the great chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is between two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
It overlooks North Shore (North Harbour district) on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay to the north and down to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches, with a touch of shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
And the homes on Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the wealthy districts of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the centre of Auckland.
There are beaches for families, sometimes with lots of people, with many shops. It’s certainly worth it.
The main local beer is “Number One”, it’s not a complex beer, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines to try, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might be better.
Tap water is very good to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, a cappuccino arrives brimming right up to the top with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the coral reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to these causes on the reef are rare.
Follow what the authorities said anyway, obey the signs, and be careful with the safety signals.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and in the nearby estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the certainty and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other places to stay, like campsites, always through a travel agency.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer options, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
You can also hold the reservation for a while if you need time to think it over or get the documents ready for your arrival (for example, a visa).
Any modification or request, however, must first go through the agent and not directly to the hotel.
For such festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site, and most of these people consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a good camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage is over, there are still parts of the festival where music plays late into the night.
Certain festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is, because going through the ice causes a horrible noise for everyone involved.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the regulations).
Casinos spend a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are often absent, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep customers in good spirits and continue to make them spend money.
Local establishments offer free alcoholic drinks. However, intoxication hinders judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone wishing to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you shouldn’t drive as if you were on asphalt.
During snowstorms, quite a bit of snow can fall and block you in very quickly.
Visibility is also limited by snow, condensation, or frost on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and they strongly attract many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to a journey overland to observe the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Certain animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the machines, and the standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a “bush walk”, “hiking safari” or “footing”) consists of an excursion on foot, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in a complicated situation.
The rules on cancellations vary, but in March the cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
If estimates suggest that most events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket selling for 7,000 yen.
I’m ironing my clothes now, otherwise I’ll have to go out to do it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if one is missing from the room.
If a groom isn't available, or if you don't feel like getting dressed up in ironed socks, you can use a straw, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which could make it shrink or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and if you were to have a problem, you should consider the fact of buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
The travelers found parasites to which they were not accustomed in their place of origin.
Harmful animals can spoil food, cause irritation, or in rare cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that harm or kill people as is commonly the case, are not typically qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping represents the opportunity to buy tax-exempt goods and can be found in certain specific places.
Travelers coming from countries with higher taxes often save a good amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, be careful: significant potholes, narrow lanes and sharp bends are common.
The speed limits shown are quite a bit lower than in previous and subsequent sessions – commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and obedience to these limits is even more important than in other circumstances.
Curiously, however, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, like in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are truly rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with cooked apples present in the sweet all year round, and there would be strawberries that pop up outside of summer.
Many German pastries baked in the oven have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. These popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want pastries that are simple but rich, try the one that, depending on the place, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry should be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a comprehensive term that includes a great variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without other adjectives, the term tends to refer to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine presents a spectrum of simple, aromatic dishes, with the main aromas that Javanese people love being shallots, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down from both sides of the saddle.
The stirrups provide stability to the rider but they can present safety problems due to the potential for a rider to get their foot caught.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, they could be dragged away if the horse starts to run. To minimize this risk, a series of safety precautions must be taken.
As a first item, most knights wore riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that help prevent the saddle from falling off when pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – the first Chilean destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The climbs include breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes through its infinite potential of walls.
Winter sliding sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve speeding down snow-covered terrain on skis or with a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiastic travelers, sometimes called “ski fanatics”, who plan entire vacations to ski in a specific place.
The concept of skiing is so old – the caves depicting skiers go back as far as 5,000 BC!
Ski mountaineering as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by some Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
It’s related, but usually doesn’t include ski mountaineering or alpinism, since these last two activities are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski itinerary as similar to a similar hiking itinerary.
With good conditions, I can take you further than walking – but rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through different countries would imply having to send many visa requests and have your passport checked in many instances.
The Schengen area, however, in this respect acts as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having your passport checked.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition of what handmade goods can be defined as antiques. Certain tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit potentially being lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Products made by hand could be defined as antiques even if they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for other types of professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all the Sami were involved in the large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, keeping the reindeer mainly as pack animals.
In recent times, many Sami are finding modern employment. Tourism provides an important income to Sapmi, the region of the Sami people.
Even though it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word "Singano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel alert, your travel insurance or your cancellation insurance may be affected.
You could also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but this advice might be addressed only to its citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The bulletins are just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The facts that are presented are often quick, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information that is available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather exists everywhere in the world, and there are different types, which depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and wildfires are forms of severe weather, such as storms, tornadoes, water spouts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena can include thunderstorms, snowstorms, hail, and dust storms.
It is strongly advised that travelers be aware of any risk of severe weather that may affect the area they are visiting, as this could alter their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
An internet search for “Hostile Environment Course” will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues we discussed here in detail, and quite extensively, typically with examples from practical experience.
A course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications that cover war zones are few.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they carry valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral passports (x) or updated documents with a preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of governments to accept these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint controls have become much more intrusive since the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people before undergoing surgery shouldn’t be expected to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flows that return from the breaking waves onto the beach, often over a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections, and there a fast current towards the depths can form.
The majority of deaths happen as a result of the exhaustion of trying to swim upstream against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you resurface from the current, going back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head towards places where you won't be pulled under, or, depending on your skill or whether you've been noticed or not, you might be able to hope for a rescue.
The shock of returning home hits before culture shock (there isn't even a "honeymoon" phase), it lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have managed to adapt to a new culture often find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living away, you adapt to the new culture and you lose some of your old habits from your original culture.
When you see someone for the first time, people are likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People don't expect anything but patience and understanding, and these too are necessary for travelers returning home.
The light and sound show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You will be able to see the pyramids in the dark, and you will be able to see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is really like an account book.
The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several states and have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, which is the flooded caldera of an still active volcano providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula here merge with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360km-long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the peak of 4892 m of Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cellular coverage, a satellite phone might be the only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn’t replace a cell phone, since to use the former you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used for deliveries, including boat transport, and shipments that have remote data and require voice communication.
Your local provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A popular option for those planning a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is popular especially among young people who have just finished school, which allows them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, taking a sabbatical year abroad can improve your chances of obtaining higher education in your country.
Typically, there is a fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is beautiful for boats. The “land of a thousand lakes” also has many islands in the lakes and archipelagos along its coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes, a yacht isn't really necessary.
Even if the archipelagos and the larger lakes are quite large enough for yachts, a small boat or even a kayak is a completely different experience.
Going by boat is the national pastime in Finland; there’s a boat for every seven or eight people.
The same thing happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it’s a rather unique situation (in Holland the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the characteristic Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic center for a couple of days, returning and sleeping on the overnight ship.
If you disembark via a cruise excursion, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see from the map, Berlin is not at all near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversions to so many things that everyone has.
Knowing something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear based on the unknown and not being in control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is truly important for travel documents, goods, or replacement parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the bigger companies have their planes, but on other, more remote routes, there was a problem.
If they sent the goods by air freight, on certain routes they would sometimes need to spend whole days dealing with unloading and customs.
The only way to make it easier was to send it as registered baggage. Air regulations don't allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is where you come into play.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company pay for it for you).
In any case, it’s not cheap: as a general rule, you should expect to pay up to four times what you pay in economy for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there’s no reason to look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights between A and B.
And airlines know full well that there’s a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure in political negotiations.
In Moldova, the most common religion is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second most important port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once a historic city of Smyrna, it is now only a modern commercial center, developed and intense, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, buildings with glass windows and modern shopping centers are punctuated by traditional rooftops with red tiles, the 18th-century market, and instead mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The small village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are some interesting marble sculptures of doves above certain tombs.
Walking around the curious little village for an hour is worth it.
To the north, easily reachable, there is the romantic and seductive city of Sintra, made famous to foreigners after a sensational account of its splendors was written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, you can also visit the grand Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a place famous throughout the world for the apparitions of the Madonna.
You are kindly asked to remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, and also a site that holds immeasurable significance for a large part of the world’s population.
There are still so many men and women alive who spent time suffering there, and many more who saw their loved ones being buried or working themselves to exhaustion there, both Jews and non-Jews.
You are asked to treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site with signs or gratings on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and a large majority understand it, while virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is indicated only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
Regular announcements on the subway are only given in Catalan, but special announcements are made by an automatic system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even if this is often a mistaken stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like someone who is “well-bred” (well-raised). This will make getting your bearings relatively easy.
The Parisians’ prejudices will quickly evaporate if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is largely forested, mainly with beech and fir trees, and it features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities due to its range of microclimates, diverse soils and variable altitude levels.
This area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
The rare fauna includes the brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the rock partridge, together with many other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women had to wear skirts that covered the knees, as well as having covered shoulders.
The majority of monasteries provided halls for women who arrived without them, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Following the same rule, men are obliged to wear trousers that cover the knees.
Even these suits are to be taken on loan from the entrance warehouse, but these clothes aren’t washed after every use so you might feel uncomfortable wearing them. One size fits all for all the men!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of other areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially male livestock), and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple and popular dish, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and available toppings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All names are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
Perhaps it also makes reading a bit simpler, even if writing is a little more complicated since you have to figure out if a verb or adjective is used with a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian because almost all the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also remember to pronounce the 'r' and 'rr' differently: in Venetian they are pronounced the same, but not in Italian.
Persian has a relatively easy and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar guide will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and the understanding of expressions.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easy to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish could quickly come to the conclusion that there’s no need to study it separately.
Premodern observers are usually obsolete today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at its peak wasn’t the only problem, they are often located in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous structures in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of the cherry blossoms blooming, called “hanami”, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first festivals of the blossoming were held by the emperor solely for him and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to dig up “just one” specimen.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, digging up “specimens” will get you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and an easy place to get around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But being in the tropics, just a few degrees north of the Equator, you’ll have to cope with the heat (always) and the sun that beats down (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional site of burial for the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you think you’re taking goes to Hebron and not just to the Jewish settlement near Kiryat Arba.
The internal canals are a good theme around which to base your vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or navigating along the Erie Canal.
Also suggest itineraries for bike paths or popular hiking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions linked to the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians throughout the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night somewhere outdoors to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many Christian families often celebrate Easter Eve, the night of Saturday, during the Easter week, with congregations often entering churches to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced: goats, horses, cows, rabbits, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, given that the sky is dark pretty much all day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners might expect.
The jacket and tie are the standard attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and it emphasizes teamwork rather than recognizing individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain their supervisor’s approval for every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their supervisor’s instructions without asking questions.
