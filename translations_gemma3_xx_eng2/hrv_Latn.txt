It is increasingly confirmed that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but details are now available that fossils usually don't provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper side of this animal's feathers was chestnut brown, and the underside was pale or carotenoid-colored.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central shaft known as the rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – first and second order barbs – researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later in relation to these other features.
Based on the structure of the feathers, it can be concluded that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers claim that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of the coloration of adult specimens, not the down of juveniles.
The research has shown that despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample is part of plumage with the coloration of an adult bird, and not down from a chick.
A car bomb exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.
From the governor's office, they report that nineteen police officers were among the injured.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was intended to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was aiming for is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way pull the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have proven that dark matter interacts with each other in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a kind of halo around the galaxy, consisting of a multitude of small particles.

Temperature differences between night and day, visible in infrared imagery, suggest these are likely caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding areas, and warmer at night.
“The temperature inside the caves isn’t as uniform as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent considering they are large openings in the ground,” says Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, high technology is traditionally not used during voting: voters are isolated in booths, where a pre-printed ballot paper with the name of the chosen candidate is inserted into an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the ballot envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The procedure is very strictly regulated by French election law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes are added except those cast by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four female skiers from the women's group failed to finish the course, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh state police have found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D K Arya stated, “We have arrested five people suspected of raping a woman from Switzerland and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when it was hit by a car, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services are freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court facing a charge of murdering his son since then.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but there is a possibility that eyewitness testimony will be derivative, as many media outlets have published her photograph.
This is standard practice everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently, and the courts considered the publication of the photographs potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that “it seems journalists are walking a tightrope when publishing photos, etc., of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which leads all criminal proceedings, announced to reporters that it will not be giving further comment at least until the indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will reportedly concern a dispute over borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle Eastern war.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence lasting only five years.
Hunters in a trial hunt aimed at controlling pests would be under strict supervision by park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the game management program of the Sporting Shooters Association, as part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS Parks, the four shooters selected to carry out the initial cull operation received extensive safety briefings and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday to the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary electoral council in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited the previous resignation of the CEC as part of a package of measures leading up to the new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were sparked by the absence of elections that were supposed to have been held as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing six fires and resulting in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry stated that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company deems “not serious”.
The Ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Marianas Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
From the Civil Protection Office of the Northern Adriatic Islands, it was announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists captive by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at tourists from his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of hormones accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of two months. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnells stated, "Luna was as strange as I am, if not more… I love her and I will miss her… I hope she’s gone to a better place."
Of the 1400 respondents surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposing the proposal for Australia to become a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of survey respondents share the same view and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian head of state.
29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, as well as three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his health is now in doubt due to complaints.
He couldn't take painkillers because they were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, along with organic materials that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets form, especially how Earth formed, with which comets collided long ago.
Cuomov's (53) term began earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow for shorter aircraft flight routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older technology based on radar, this system uses satellite technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport options will be organised, and overground trains will not be stopping at Wembley. Furthermore, vehicle parking facilities, and on-street parking and public transport use will not be available.
Due to fear of transport shortages, the possibility has arisen that the match might have to be moved indoors without fans.
Research published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved within just two generations, despite the belief that this process takes much longer, due to interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the newcomer finch species, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all sorts of forms. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and unraveled. It can be hammered or rolled flat.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is called chemical pH. Red cabbage juice can serve as an indicator.
The brine changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in the abbreviation pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball using clean, wet hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tickle and cause a shell to form.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, every house was equipped with at least one flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in buildings of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled in social settings.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has brought unimaginable changes to the world. The biggest change was that the invention of the wheel allowed us much easier and faster transportation.
He enabled the invention of the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche concept, that is, the special position each cat occupies, so it doesn't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Lion prides consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and form large families of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the panther genus) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the full-throated roar a lion has, but more like a series of unintelligible, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate animals they eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing where the prey has moved on the ground.
They see very well in the dark using night vision and move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then ambushing it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from (for example during a crossing over a mountain or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment.
A new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs characteristics or adaptations that differ from previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it becomes increasingly dissimilar to the other population.
Over time, after thousands, and even millions of years, the two populations will become so different in appearance that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that people breathe in and then take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw held more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the palate, meaning there was no hope for anyone who crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a toothed beak. His diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and there may even have been cannibalism.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even colossal dinosaurs like T. Rex wouldn't have been his match.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a certain number of unusual or exotic delicacies that included wild boar, peacocks, snails, and dormice.
The other difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on stools, while wealthy men enjoyed communal feasts where they dined reclining on their sides.
The meals of the ancient Romans could not have contained ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they were unfamiliar with corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s house.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by staging ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramids were shaped into towers, so-called ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a particularly divine sanctuary.
In the warm climates of the Middle East, a house wasn't so important.
Most of the life of Hebrew families took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; shops had counters open to the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norse sagas state that Erik the Red, after being exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland while travelling west and gave it that name.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although each country was considered "Scandinavian," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written ""Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776."" The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for certain who wrote this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches), but it is known that it was rolled up for storage shortly after its creation.
So, that entry was likely just added as a marker.
Landings as part of D-Day and the subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south remained still unfree.
There, the French from “Vichy France” were in power. These were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked Southern France. The attack is known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together – a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a society in a way.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a cultural legacy, and equitable dissemination.
Less prominent cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence, and thus we fail to recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially established a weak central government consisting only of a congress through the constitutional act Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and, lacking state or judicial authority, relied on competent bodies for the implementation of all acts, bodies that often did not cooperate.
He also lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
A unanimous agreement of all states was required to amend the Agreement, and the states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions at the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
Since it consists of a cluster (group) of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan begins as early as the 15th century, when European sailors, while sailing near the island, recorded its name as Ilha Formosa, “beautiful island.”
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan in 1624 and initiated a transformation of Indigenous grain production practices, employing Chinese workers to labor on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they were originally created.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, the same ratio is found in image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's slightly confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio expressed in simple whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, formats from the APS group) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often broken and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism with a certain retention of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church became the subject of criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European states with different languages and customs.
The immense power of Christianity influenced everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and that church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it adheres to those principles.
Shortly after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, which caused danger for ships of neutral parties as well.
Given the lack of significant interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a pacifist attitude and a desire for separation prevailed among most citizens and the people.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation that Charles Batchelor (his foreman at his previous job) had written to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different historical periods; each phase of China or each family in power was recognizable as a dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed a period of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Era of Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were waged among nobles in their struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the grand palace of Xi’an.
The consequences were social and political in nature, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not the ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men, and opportunities for success were given to the most ambitious and successful.
The same holds true for the army, as after the revolution ranks were obtained based on ability, not social status.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions beyond the confines of his previous life. He would visit the cave that became known as “Hira” on Mount “Noor” (light) so that he could think more clearly.
A cave that has survived throughout history provides a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you are certain it exists. Once you are inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing.
The Pyramid of Cheops, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and a multitude of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The notation for "bowing upwards" looks like a V, while "bowing downwards" resembles a paperclip or a square without a bottom side.
The upward bow marking indicates you should start from the tip and push the bow, while the downward bow marking indicates you should start from the frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A raised bow typically produces a softer sound, while a lowered bow is more powerful and assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the bow stroke markings are printed for musical reasons, and should generally be followed.
A frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister Elizabeth were forced by a crowd of women to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the horrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses, and bond interest was processed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profit resulting from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will form the base profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order originated.
We usually refer to the time of these events as the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict understanding that human destiny is guided by the fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely above cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the invention of the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network throughout the country is not cost-effective for just a few cars, so new ways of production have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars leads to a higher number of road accidents, which results in the discovery of new techniques in healthcare for treating injuries.
In Romanticism, there was a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography emerge, aligning with the physical dwelling place of a society, and are therefore superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from the 4th century AD to approximately 1100 AD.
The situation worsened in the twelfth century largely due to the fact that Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was in the period from the 10th to the 11th century and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication, styles in the West lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of that era, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and often organic system that utilizes seeds native to the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, which is still true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the year of birth, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the methods most commonly used to illustrate the importance of socialization is citing examples of unfortunate cases of children who did not undergo socialization by adults during their upbringing, whether as a result of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncivilized or feral. Some feral children are captured by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, child abandonment is a result of parents refusing to accept that their child has a severe intellectual or mental disability.
Wild children may experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If raised entirely by animals, a feral child displays behaviors (within the limits of their physical capabilities) that are almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised them, such as fear of humans or indifference towards humans.
Although learning through projects should facilitate learning and make it more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Setting up scaffolding, i.e., providing support, is not a teaching method, but rather assistance for individuals facing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as is the animated paperclip that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
The virtual scaffolding setup is internalized within the software and is intended for testing, guiding, and explaining procedures that a student may find too challenging to solve independently.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't stimulating, caring, and educational, yet it still happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is obligated to provide safe homes, caring foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should meet all the needs missing from the home they were removed from.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When researching visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recordings has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work *The President’s Speech*, argues that individuals who cannot understand speech due to brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He hinted that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation transfer variability between these two sources.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to humans struggle to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Indeed, failure has serious consequences: slower growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest when raw.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also contains large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
When all is considered, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved the "protein intake issue" in almost the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the practice of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then returning to sleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
That is possible with the simple use of a relatively quiet alarm clock to become conscious without fully waking up.
If you realize you're turning off your alarm in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive life force is present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can experience enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga awakens kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the heart of Tibetan meditation. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, differences in systems, procedures, and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years and would be led by truly authorized armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, those plans collapsed almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered Poland and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern Polish regions, thereby violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping goods by boat is certainly the most efficient way for a large number of people and a large quantity of goods to cross the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously denying the enemy the ability to move theirs.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies not succeeded, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it had with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Docile goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were guarded by so-called *kozari*, usually children or adolescents – a term for shepherds who tend to goats. These livestock farming methods are still used today.
Rail tracks for carts pulled by horses were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden tracks for wagons consisted only of parallelly arranged planks, they allowed horses pulling the wagons to move faster and haul heavier loads than would have been possible on the somewhat bumpier roads of that era.
Thresholds were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails could be more effective with iron on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the cart.
In the end, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first completely iron rails were presented in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (upright man).
Their ancestors, australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal walking appeared in australopithecines around 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it’s like treating the symptoms. However, if we don’t seek a solution that is only temporary, we must find the root of those problems and neutralize them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems are growing due to overpopulation and people’s extravagant lifestyles.
After Congress adopted the handwritten draft on July 4th, which was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent several blocks away to the print shop of John Dunlop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Dunlap broadsides”.
John Nixon first publicly read the document on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving copies of Dunlap’s broadside are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The original handwritten manuscript has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many don't recognize them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Many bird characteristics resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computing jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or household poisonous chemicals.
On the label, look for specific first aid instructions related to that poison.
Entomologists use the term "buba" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This concept originates from bedbugs, insects that have very well adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and assassin bugs depend on their hosts, in whose nests or living spaces they live.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it a leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
Such couples can give their child up for adoption.
In adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method is actually a guideline for most scientific research.
Besides that method, experimentation—that is, trials which represent tests for eliminating one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions, and observation—also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not merely a response to external cyclic stimuli, have been discovered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles even if there are no external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading proposals that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments that revealed DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a multitude of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are of the germline.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and commute to work by car, while those whose workplace is the place they just left pass by them.
In this dynamic transport scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a traffic system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has thrown the biosphere out of one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
Why are traffic systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something much bigger at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and construction of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This allows them a larger number of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
Several thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, but many were convinced of the opposite – that the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable since we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles wide in places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Water from thousands of smaller rivers flows into it.
Although stone pyramids were built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is composed of one or a mixture of more than four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized about them changing into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, alloys may exist that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close companion to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost status and is used less and less frequently.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don’t even need pencil sharpeners anymore.
We can only speculate what will happen with the keyboard when something new appears.
A physical bomb operates on the principle of taking energy to assemble a nucleus with numerous protons and neutrons.
It’s roughly like pushing a heavy cart uphill. By splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with slight provocation or even spontaneously.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. We call the outer layer of the Moon the crust.
The crust thickness is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the area of lunar seas, and thicker in the area of the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more dark areas because the crust is thinner. Lava reached the surface more easily there.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growing up.
These theories consider what drives some people to want what they want and what phenomena in their environment motivate them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers start managing former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain “part of the team.”
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting evaluations, delegating authority, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who believes they must change everything they have done so far and do things their own way.
The team leader is ultimately responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a gap between leaders and the rest.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent the closest point of contact with the physical group.
They are often more autonomous than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
“The Invisible Team” represents a leadership team to whom every member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would the organization go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization again? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
After the effective use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the fore.
As a result, the process of organization that strives to overcome an obstacle through collaboration can lead to a new, innovative process for fulfilling customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method by which organizations can achieve a higher degree of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This narrows and significantly refines the field of research.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in specific mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice and faces.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because they are incorporated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a significant part of every class. The teacher would often gladly take her students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution for virtual field trips. Students can tour museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtually sharing field trips is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the page changes each year, but older versions are preserved online as a kind of memorial.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills. When they start blogging, students often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually corrects that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also “forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them.” The need to stimulate audience interest inspires them to be inventive and engaging (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to transfer learning beyond the traditional school environment.
Appropriate use of blogs “can encourage students to analytical and critical thinking; by actively responding to materials on the internet, students can define their position in the context of others’ writings and present their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is a charming capital city of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls are located somewhat further south, while the north is home to pristine natural beauty in the Muskoka region and beyond.
Because of all those things, foreigners experience Ontario as essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely dominated by uninhabited wilderness.
For a surprising population comparison: there are more African Americans living in the US than citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to plant and animal life.
Most smaller islands are independent states or have ties with France and are known as luxury resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which took deep root on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area surrounds the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that women traveling state they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that might be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Firmly reject men and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (it’s not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and during the times of the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids, the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
Goma was destroyed in 2002 by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the nature of the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The town also serves as a starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking options in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorbike taxi). The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, we use “Timbuktu” today as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction and possessing an airport, Timbuktu is today a deprived city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
That was one of the main locations where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is the complete opposite of other cities in the country because it has more influences from the Arab world than from Africa.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park’s area of 19,500 km² is divided into 14 different ecozones, each inhabited by a different species of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance tickets are required.
Someone might also find it useful to buy a Wild Card which grants access to certain parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong got its name from Hong Kong Island, which is a major hub for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is comparable to a glittering column chart, which is even more noticeable thanks to the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
Those lands were appropriated by British colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remaining areas of powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges valley.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by waterlogged areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer now inhabit it.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Given that intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most counties, small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as the towns of Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
A suspension bridge spans the Oyapock River. The bridge over the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be opened in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community settled in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The province of Chaco was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Following the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay was formed, previously known as the “Great Province of the Indies.”
The Spanish began a period of colonization lasting three centuries.
Since its founding with Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely succeeded in preserving its indigenous character and identity.
The Argentinian national team and its players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for matches, please check the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, but they may accept British and American currency; inquire with the owner in advance to find out about acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone; temperatures of +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling that it’s colder than the thermometer shows.
There aren't distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is generally the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park have become accustomed to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, keep in mind that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly scented foods, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
An infamous naval battle unfolded in the port in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, the supreme leader Tupua Tamasesea Lealofia III was killed during a peaceful gathering in the city.
As Auckland spreads across two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, it is safe to swim in them, and many are shaded by Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that can get crowded, with a long line of shops stretching along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One". The beer isn't complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines you should try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might suit your palate better.
Tap water is safe to drink, but if you're hesitant, bottled water is readily available.
The concept of a “flat white” coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is an “espresso”, cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with Belgian chocolate. The fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the aforementioned causes are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and adhere to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths north of the town of 1770 from October to April. They sometimes appear in other months as well.
Sharks exist, but they often attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance lifts a weight off the traveler’s shoulders, as they know they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents commonly offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
I can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents required for arrival at your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, a large majority of attendees camp at the festival grounds and most of them consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you will have to come early to get a seat.
Please keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you travel through the northern Baltic Sea in winter, be careful when choosing your cabin as passage through the ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises do not need a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos typically aim to maximize the amount of time and money guests spend. They usually have no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some establishments offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or across mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little traction and you can't drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short period of time to get you stuck in it.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or wind-blown snow, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, but traffic generally flows without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is likely the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the best experience for numerous visitors.
The term "safari" in everyday usage refers to a journey by land with the purpose of observing magnificent African wildlife, especially in savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk", "trekking safari", or "safari on foot") consists of walking that lasts from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for the 2020 Games before they were postponed, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus cancellation policies were not extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 ¥.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels will rent you an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it’s enough to boil water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in effectiveness, and if you have any doubts, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not accustomed to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, transmit poison, or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through force are generally not classified as plagues.
Shopping in duty-free shops presents an opportunity to acquire products exempt from taxes and excise duties at specific locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially when purchasing alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo – Pittsburg highway, often passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared for anything: steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and upcoming sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
Interestingly, however, the mobile service here is better than on many other sections of the road, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good and varied in Bavaria, much like those of our southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Pastries with fruit are common, for example, apples which are added to pastries all year round, and cherries and plums which are used in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A cup of strong coffee often goes well with popular pastries.
If you're craving small but generous bites, try what's called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curries in the interior of northern India and Pakistan; in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most often used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago, and consists of a range of simply seasoned dishes that emphasize flavors of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices, favored by the people of Java.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but also involve certain safety risks as the rider’s feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it bolts. To reduce the risk, certain safety measures should be taken.
First, most drivers wear boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Furthermore, saddles, and English saddles in particular, contain safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the rider pulls it backwards during a fall.
Cochamó Valley is a major climbing destination in Chile, also known as the South American Yosemite due to its variety of large granite cliffs and spires.
From the peaks, breathtaking views stretch out. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports involving descending slopes, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered slope using skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, and many people known as "ski enthusiasts" plan their annual vacations around skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – images in caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Traveling with a backpack on your back and on skis – also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering.
It is associated with alpine skiing or mountaineering, although it doesn't usually involve them. Mountaineering typically takes place on steep terrain and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski slope as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than by walking, but you will very rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of numerous independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for a visa multiple times and going through passport controls.
However, the Schengen Area functions as one country in this regard.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you possess a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member country individually, which saves time, money, and reduces paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques. Some tax authorities define an antique as goods over 100 years old.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques even if they were created later than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami people, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many people in other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; rather, they lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer primarily serving to pull loads for them.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi area, Sápmi.
Although the word "Ciganin" is widely used, especially among non-Romance peoples, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are traveling to is added to the list of countries for which a warning has been issued, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can consult with other governments besides your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The expressed opinions are often brief, general, and overly simplistic in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of dangerous weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather events include thunderstorms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of bad weather in their area as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
If you do an online search with the keywords "hostile environment awareness training", you will find the address of a local company.
The course generally covers all the issues discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many lessons related to first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Many books and magazines deal with wilderness survival, but publications covering war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid return travel documents.
The willingness to issue passports not specifying gender (X) or updated documents to reflect a person’s preferred name and gender varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Searches at checkpoints have also become more drastic in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery are likely to be subjected to privacy and dignity violations when going through a scanner.
A rip current is a return flow of water breaking on the shore, often against a reef or similar structure.
Due to the subsurface topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and the formation of a fast current towards greater depths is possible.
Death most often occurs when a person tires trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to swim in a way that avoids being caught in the current again, or, depending on your skills and whether anyone has noticed you, you can wait for help.
Reverse culture shock happens before culture shock. The enjoyment phase is shorter, the shock lasts longer, and can be more serious.
Travelers who adapt easily to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to their homeland.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that belonged to your own.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People may not expect that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and merchants. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is in the role of backdrop and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases – sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, which is home to the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded crater of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here converge into a plateau, then rise again and form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is cut through by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest Antarctic mountains, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak Vinson at 4,892 m, are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range.
In remote locations where there is no signal coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you need to make calls outdoors and the satellite must be in your line of sight to complete a call.
The service is often used in freight forwarding, on recreational boats, but also on expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
Your telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular with those leaving school as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, attending a course abroad during a gap year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your home country.
There is usually a tuition fee for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, traveling by smaller boats or kayak offers a completely different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands that number is one in forty).
Most popular Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historical city for several days, and return to the boat to sleep at night.
If you are travelling to the mainland as part of boat excursions, you will not require a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There’s no need to be ashamed of it: it’s no different from the fears and aversions many people feel towards other things.
Understanding how an aircraft functions and what happens during flight can help some people overcome fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for the fast delivery of shipments. Often, time is of critical importance when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but a problem arose with other routes and smaller companies.
If the cargo were sent by air, unloading and customs procedures on some routes would take days.
The only way to get through this faster is to send the items as checked baggage. According to the airline's rules, baggage cannot travel without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
It goes without saying that you’ll be able to fly first or business class if you set aside a hefty stack of bills for that privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, it’s not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost up to four times more than a standard economy class seat, that is, eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airline companies know very well that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and they set prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The language of the population is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
That conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a very well-connected transportation hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna (Izmir) is today a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center surrounded by mountains and lying around a vast bay.
Wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are interspersed with classic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, old mosques and churches, although the city’s atmosphere feels more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík you can see the nearby island of Eysturoy, which is also home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above certain graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour walk through the intriguing village.
To the north lies the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron recorded a brilliant depiction of its beauties.
Bus Scotturb 403 regularly runs to Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Altar), a site of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please keep in mind that you are visiting a mass grave site of almost immeasurable significance to a substantial portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived, as well as those whose close relatives were killed there or worked to death, whether they were Jewish or not.
Treat this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not deface the place with painted or carved graffiti on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Yes, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements on the subway are in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced via an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being rude and arrogant egocentrics.
Although it’s often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is to be polite – in other words, to act like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). This will significantly ease your stay.
The aloof exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, with beech, spruce, and fir trees being the most common. The park is characterized by a blend of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park is home to a particularly wide range of plant communities due to its diverse microclimates, soil types, and variations in altitude within the park.
In that area live exceptionally diverse species of animals and birds.
Here you can find rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, along with many other more common species.
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover the knees, as well as clothing that covers their shoulders.
Most monasteries have head coverings for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but the clothing isn’t washed after each visitor so you might not feel comfortable wearing it. The sizes are one-size-fits-all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
Pa amb Oli is a beloved simple dish especially eaten in summer: it’s bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any topping that’s on hand, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" which means "You," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to pay particular attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be careful to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: *caro* means dear, while *carro* means wagon/car.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar beginner’s guide will help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish may easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are today most often outdated and used as museums or educational sites.
Mild pollution in their heyday wasn't the problem it is today. They are typically found in cities or on campuses and are more accessible than those built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the plum blossom was a beloved flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial palace.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally maintained garden, you will be ejected without further discussion for collecting "samples".
Singapore is generally a very safe place and it is very easy to get around, and once you arrive you can buy almost anything.
Located in the midst of the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll need to contend with both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
Several buses are traveling north to Hebron, a burial site traditionally believed to be the resting place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to travel on goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, cruising through interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also mark routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions characteristic of this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
As is customary, Easter night is spent outdoors to watch the sunrise.
For that tradition, there are, of course, Christian theological explanations, but it may be a pre-Christian fertility rite in honor of the arrival of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil is often held on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and communities begin the celebration of Christ's resurrection when the clock strikes midnight.
Most animals originally came to the islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals couldn't reach the islands, and thus the giant tortoise became the main herbivore on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means the sun does not appear above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky will be dark almost constantly.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is significantly more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
At work, suits are worn, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Teamwork in the workplace is crucial – the emphasis is on collective effort, not celebrating individual achievements.
Workers frequently have to seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors’ instructions without question.
