At the end of 2017, Smirnoff appeared on the television shopping channel QVC.
The company "Ring" also resolved a dispute with competing security company "ADT Corporation".
Although one experimental vaccine has proven capable of reducing mortality from the Ebola virus, no medication has yet clearly demonstrated the ability to cure an existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, "ZMapp," initially appeared to be a promising solution to the problem, but official studies showed it had a lower impact on preventing mortality than previously thought.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other types of therapies to it.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s assertion that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sports, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than by suspending certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can reveal how the extent of Larry Nassar’s abuse, as so bravely described by the survivors, could remain hidden for so long and encompasses all necessary and appropriate reforms.
The USA Gymnastics Federation and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and fair environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his advisor and later in Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – a theory already widely accepted – but also provides information that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on top, but carotenoid-colored underneath.
This discovery also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other characteristics typical of feathers – namely, barbs and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later in the evolutionary development than these features.
The feather structure suggests they weren’t used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers noted that, although this is a dinosaur’s tail, the sample shows the plumage of adult birds, not the down of a hatchling.
Researchers suggested that, although this is a dinosaur’s tail, the sample shows adult plumage rather than down from a juvenile.

Public outrage has led to current efforts to draft a sexual content policy plan for a website hosting millions of openly licensed media files.
The completed work was primarily theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made of the Strelnnieks galaxy.
The effect sought by the teams could be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a halo around the galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
In the interview, he said that the new variation causes "very great concern and anxiety, as it has a very high mortality rate."
Dr. Molls believes that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
During the year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among people sick with tuberculosis is low; 6,000 out of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at a specific point in time.

Infrared images show temperature changes during the day and night and indicate potential caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.
"Their thermal operating characteristics are not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology working group and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In French elections, technology has rarely been used: voters enter a booth and place the printed ballot with their desired candidate into an envelope.
After election officials have verified the voter’s identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voting register.
The French electoral law establishes a rather strict order regarding the election process.
Since the 1988 elections, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no ballots inside them at the start of the election and that no other ballots are added, except those of properly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following established procedures.

Hünem and Prais must appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on February 16th.
The deceased were 25-year-old Nikolass Aldens and 21-year-old Zaharijs Kudebaks. Kudebaks was the driver.
Edgars Vegilla sustained hand and jaw injuries, while Kristofers Šneiders required reconstructive facial surgery.
Uka’s weapon fired inaccurately when he aimed for the fifth man’s head. Schneider has intractable pain, blindness in one eye, a missing portion of his skull, and his face has been reconstructed from titanium.
Schneiders testified via video link from the USAF base in his homeland.
Besides the Wednesday incident, Karpanedo competed in two individual championship downhill races.
In her first slalom competition, she did not finish the first run. The same result was achieved by 36 out of 116 competitors in these races.
In other competitions, namely giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's seated downhill with a total run time of 4:41.30, which was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place finisher Giongi Dani from Hungary.
Four female downhill skiers did not finish their runs, and 45 out of all 117 skiers were not ranked in the standings.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
General Deputy Inspector D.K. Aria said: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and have also recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are known as Baba Kandžars, Bhuta Kandžars, Rampro Kandžars, Gaza Kandžars and Vishnu Kandžars.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when a car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the manager sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been held in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in connection with the charge of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but witness testimony may be inadmissible as her image has been widely published.
It is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Dundee University Professor Pamela Ferguson notes: "It seems that journalists are treading on thin ice by publishing photographs and other information about suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comment will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to a dispute over borders desired by Palestine, based on the situation prevailing before the 1967 Middle East war.
It is reported that topics such as the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan Valley were also discussed.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, but PI agrees to such a presence for only five years.
The foresters had to carefully manage the shooters who participated in the supplementary pest control trial, as this trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through the partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales (NSW) Shooting Federation, and within the framework of the Shooting Federation’s hunting program.
According to information provided by Mika O'Flynn, Acting Director of Parks Conservation and Cultural Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first culling operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelli yesterday accepted the oath from the new Provisional Electoral Commission (PEC), which consists of nine members.
That is Martell's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed an earlier withdrawal from the CAP as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Martell Commission was a response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the inability to hold elections, some dating back to 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires in which four people sustained minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reports that it is aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economics (METI) announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company has described as "insignificant."
The ministry responded, calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Marianas at 7:19 AM local time (Friday, 9:19 PM GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer seized Hong Kong tourists as hostages, hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been released, but the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as Filipino photographers, were quickly released.
The photographers later took the place of the elderly lady, as she needed to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
The son followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began researching premature births in his free time.
Her research indicates that after hormone administration, it accelerates fetal lung maturation.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two “black boxes” – flight data recorders.
Other wrestlers, who were her companions, also showed respect to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died the night two moons were visible. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, known as "Goldust", commented that "Luna was as quirky as I was...maybe even quirkier...I loved her and I will miss her...I hope she's in a better place now."
Among the 1400 voters surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
The acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
Such an opinion is held by 34% of poll respondents who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The conflicting results of the poll indicate that 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist at the Friendship Games had to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays, but his readiness is in doubt due to his complaints.
He wasn't allowed to use pain medication to reduce the pain, as those are banned painkillers in these games.
Professor Curtis Cooper of Central Missouri University’s mathematics and computer science department discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Several people verified this discovery by the beginning of February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets delivered water to Earth along with organic molecules capable of forming proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth was formed, as comet collisions with Earth occurred a long time ago.
The 53-year-old Kuomo began his work as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
Assumptions are being made that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
“NextGen” is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the location of pilots with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional vehicles are planned, overground trains will not stop at Wembley Stadium, and parking and ‘park and ride’ facilities will not be available at this location.
Fears of transport shortages increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
The study published on Thursday in the journal "Science" reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the new species arose in just two generations, despite the belief that such a process would take considerably longer, given the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the immigrant cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be melted into all sorts of shapes. It can even be rolled into very fine forms.
It can be stretched like a small wire, which can be bent and twisted. It can be forged or shaped into arches.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metal. It could be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn images in books, known as "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen (H letter in the pH compound) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together, and then compress them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
Hand moisture will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a complex drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the city of Minos (Crete) and on the island of Santorini (Greece).
Toilets existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women went together in mixed company.
When calling someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
In space, a satellite receives a call and almost immediately reflects it back.
A rocket sent the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a huge rocket exceeding 100 feet in height is required.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is providing much simpler and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
After that, there are several medium-sized cats eating medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a much wider variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, shrews, and birds.
The secret to their success is a niche concept – a specific task that each cat performs and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A family is formed by one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and offspring.
Mothers are usually closely connected to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs—the behavior of these two animals is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats)—and is just as deadly to their prey.
The athletic tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, make long leaps, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is in the same group (the panther genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a series of rumbling, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals for food (prey) by scent, sniffing the footprints they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move along a mountain ridge or a river, or migrate to a new island making return travel more difficult), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and various competitors, therefore the new population will require distinct traits or adaptations to be stronger competitors than they needed to be previously.
The initial population hasn't changed at all; they still require the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they become increasingly dissimilar to the other residents.
Ultimately, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important component of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants absorb nutrients from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In those long jaws were more than 70 very sharp teeth, supplemented by additional teeth on the palate, and therefore no one who crossed its path had any chance of escape.
We don’t know for sure, but it possibly had a forked tongue. Its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; a huge dinosaur like T. rex couldn’t cope with it.
Although most Roman foods would be familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and rodents called susuri.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate while sitting in chairs, whereas wealthy men preferred to hold communal banquets during which they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine certainly did not use products that were only introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and furthermore, no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People brought offerings to the gods, while priests tried to appease the gods’ needs by performing ceremonies and festivals.
In each temple there was an open temple courtyard and beyond that an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, as part of a temple, specially pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, a house wasn't so important.
The Jewish family mostly lived outdoors.
Women were cooking food in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Ancient Norse sagas recount that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter and, travelling further west, discovered a land he named Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "National Treasure", you might believe the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the truth. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words: "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text is visible, reversed, at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
So, the note was most likely just attached as a label.
The breakout from D-Day and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
It was governed by "Vichy France". These were French citizens who concluded peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in Southern France; this invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Civilization is a distinct culture formed by a very large group of people who live and work together, cooperating with each other – in other words, a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin "civilis," meaning civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and this also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization’s culture means the transmission of knowledge to multiple generations, a lasting cultural impact, and its consistent dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind significant historical evidence, and are not recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states, based on the Articles of Confederation, first established a weak central government whose only component was Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to enforce taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state governments, which were often unwilling to cooperate, hoping they would implement all the laws it passed.
He also lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
For the articles to be amended, unanimous consent from all states was required, but the states treated the central government so carelessly that their representatives often did not show up.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic games.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), ranking Japan 7th among the world's largest islands.
Thanks to the fact that Japan's territory includes several islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan’s beginnings were in the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island’s name as “Ilha Formosa,” meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of local residents' grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and, in 1885, declared the inclusion of Taiwan as a province within the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereign authority over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings constructed along the perimeter of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally came about.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the most prevalent film size during the era of analog film.
It is still being manufactured, but more importantly, its image proportions are now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many commonly accepted formats (such as the APS format group) correspond to these image aspect ratios or are very similar to them.
The much-maligned and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining the order of the image.
It is indicated that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the countries of Europe, despite differing languages and traditions.
That all-encompassing power affected absolutely everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are intended specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church in Rome has existed for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy proved effective in disrupting critical military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, as codified in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering a whole section of the ocean, which endangered even neutral vessels.
As the reaction to this tactic was limited, Germany anticipated a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the majority of people and nations considered pacifism and isolation to be the most important thing.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin working at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his previous employer’s manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different periods of time; each stage of China's development, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was a period of unstable, fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Era of Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless struggle for the throne took place among many nobles.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China, with thousands of people perishing while fighting for the most important position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, all male candidates could apply for positions, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military sphere, as army service ranks are now granted based on a person's qualities, not on belonging to a particular class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in metaphysical questions. He often went to a cave, which became known as the Cave of Hira on Mount Nora (of light), to devote himself to contemplation.
The cave itself, having survived the turns of epochs, vividly demonstrates Muhammad's yearning for spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it’s not easy to find at all, even if someone knew it existed. Entering the cave results in complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen beyond clear, beautiful skies overhead and many mountains all around. From inside the cave, little can be seen or heard of the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many massive pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," located in Egypt’s Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
An upward-pointing arc looks like a V, and a downward-pointing arc looks like a bracket or a square with its bottom edge missing.
Drawing back means you need to start from a smile and push the bow, and drawing forward means you should start at the grip (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward inflection typically produces a softer sound, while a downward inflection is stronger and more assertive.
You can mark your own fingerings, but remember that the printed fingerings are indicated for musical phrasing, and therefore should generally be followed.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, due to a crowd of market women.
In the carriage, surrounded by the crowd, they returned to Paris, with people shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
In a moment, a gang member brandished the head of the royal guard murdered at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The costs of the US imperialist war in the Philippine conquest were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the surplus profit gained from the long exploitation of the Filipino people formed the fundamental income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the environment that prompted the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages – a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
Before the High Middle Ages were the Early Middle Ages, and following the High Middle Ages came the Late Middle Ages, which ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the drive of technology or a technological imperative to a strict understanding that human destiny is fundamentally guided by the logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
In most interpretations of technological determinism, two main ideas are distinguished: that technological development proceeds largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology itself creates an “impact” on societies, and this impact is consequential rather than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the automobile definitely promotes road development.
However, the state road network is not economically viable with only a small number of cars, therefore new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the costs associated with car usage.
A large number of private cars also means a higher number of accidents, leading to the development of new methods in healthcare to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism was largely characterized by cultural determinism, which stemmed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time, a culture and customs associated with the relevant geographical region arose, which were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws because they existed in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was also considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known as a center for luxury goods, beginning around 400 AD and ending around 1100 AD.
Its status became less important in the 12th century as the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those available in the Byzantine markets.
At this very moment, Constantinople lost its title as the fashion capital, and Paris gained it.
Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th–11th centuries and later in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was largely influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, trends in the West can lag by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing, a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to grow enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic system that utilizes seeds gathered from the eco-region alongside crop rotation or other relatively straightforward methods to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, as still happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in terms of participants' age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of subcultures often emphasize their belonging by using a distinct and symbolic style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite examples of unfortunate cases involving children whose parents failed to socialize them during their upbringing due to neglect, hardship, or deliberate abuse.
Children like these are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child occurred because the parents rejected the child’s severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children in the wild may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is believed that others were raised by animals; some say they lived in the wild all alone.
Having grown up fully with animals, a feral child exhibits behavior (with physical limitations) almost identical to that of the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Focusing learning on projects should make the learning process easier and more interesting, and basing it on projects is a step forward.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support tool for people learning something new, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Support can happen both virtually and in reality, in other words, a teacher can be a support, but equally so can the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants have been integrated into the software and are designed to ask questions, suggest solutions, and explain procedures that a student might find difficult to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even cases of exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn’t nurturing, loving, and educational, yet it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our system, which provides for the fostering of children in families, must provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families must be provided with everything that was lacking in the homes from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The distinctive features of the internet create additional dimensions regarding the approach to usage and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are cited as important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Studying audience reaction to websites, Imijs and McCord (1998) also identified “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” as new motivating aspects.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions – facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that a person can determine whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay “The President’s Speech,” demonstrated how people who are unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately judge how truthful it is.
He even suggests that such an ability to interpret human behavior might also exist in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the expressed variation pool.
Segregation and recombination in each generation shifts variation back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with a digestive system like humans find it difficult to obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant resources available in the savanna.
Furthermore, it can have serious consequences: stunted growth, inadequate nutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and pods, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a lot of protein, which contains essential amino acids.
Considering all of that, it would not be surprising if our ancestors also solved their “protein problem” in a similar way to how chimpanzees living in the savanna do now.
Sleep interruption is a process where purposeful awakening occurs during normal sleep, followed by falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you to consciousness, but not fully wake you up.
If you turn off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to switch it off.
Another option based on biorhythms is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic effect) before bed to force yourself to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person experiences is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing hindering us from reaching this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and many Indian yoga methods.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to universal love.
During the practice of Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini (enlightenment) energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is Divine Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, thus leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, these countries again became hostile due to their differing systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was destined to last for the next 40 years, and real warfare was conducted on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places, using proxy armies.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became morally obsolete—almost overnight—when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army arrived and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after occupying the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods remains the most effective way to move large volumes of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of a navy has been to ensure your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while disrupting the enemy’s ability to move their nation and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans attempted to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, using primarily submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would most likely have conquered Great Britain just like all the other European countries.
Goats were most likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to cultivate them because it allowed them to easily obtain milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Home goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the foothills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goat herders, who were often children or adults, similar to the more widely known sheep herders. This herding method is still used to this day.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse railway consisted only of wooden planks laid parallel to each other, they allowed draft horses to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the bumpy roads of the time.
Sleepers were used from the very beginning to keep the rails from moving. However, people gradually realized that the rails would be even more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
It became common practice, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means ‘upright man’).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as commonly believed.
Bipedal specimens have already been found in australopithecine fossils, which lived 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although representatives of the Sahelanthropus genus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more sustainably, we can join environmental movements and even become activists, to lessen suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, it's like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has significantly changed due to humanity's scientific and technological achievements, and problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and humanity's extravagant lifestyle.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the draft of the document, hand-signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" (of the Declaration of Independence).
John Nixon conducted the first public reading of the document in the courtyard of the Independence Palace on July 8th.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. One copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides", of which copies are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving documents. The original, handwritten copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't recognize them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have many characteristics that resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary digit can only have two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits, or in computer language – bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that they don't immediately lead to a diagnosis.
The most telling sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of open medications or containers of toxic household chemicals.
Read the first aid instructions on the label for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originated from the ancient association with bedbugs, which have highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both bed bugs and cimex lectularius are parasitic pests that have adapted to live in nests or attach themselves to other bodies.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are registered in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of either themselves or the child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents' parental rights are terminated so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works, using the scientific method. In fact, this method is the driving force behind most scientific research.
Experimentation also exists, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations can also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were recognised in all matters of science, including psychology.
As fewer and fewer people knew Greek, the Western countries were cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The presence and formation process of endogenous cycles, considering the biological clock, often has a decisive impact on many observed rhythms in psychology and behavior.
Periodic rhythms not simply a response to external periodic signals have been confirmed in the vast majority of living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that continue to operate freely even without external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading demonstrations that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, labeling either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are stem cell lineage cells.
Children can only inherit mutations in germline cells, but mutations in other cells can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
In these places, one can engage in activities such as hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, or visit parks and learn about the ecosystem.
As an example, one could mention visiting Borneo to take photographs and get to know orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns drive to their workplaces, while others arrive to take their place, whose workplace is located where they have just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Now, scientists point out that an economy with such massive carbon emissions has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has underpinned human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and participates in transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear of similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do such complaints arise regarding transport systems, why do problems occur in them every day? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is the root of the problems deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their potential interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict a driver’s behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the range of driver behavior is usually quite consistent, therefore, a certain consistency can be determined in traffic flows and they can be approximately calculated mathematically.
To better reflect traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and processes of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily, as well as find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, adhering them to their bodies along their entire length.
It gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many disagreed, believing that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel like the Earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in places six miles wide.
The Amazon River contributes 20% of the water volume that flows into the oceans from all the world's rivers.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the very end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in their size and the excellent technical execution of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a language used daily by most people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they are all found in nature in free form and are relatively easy to excavate with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more specific elements. These elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
It more closely resembled the four states of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are, in principle, a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In general, everything is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a single dot at the end of this sentence would consist of trillions of them.
Thus, when the pencil appeared, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of the pencil declined, and it began to be used less frequently.
Now people write messages on a computer screen, and there is absolutely no need for a pencil sharpener.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when a newer invention appears.
An atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, like rolling heavy wheels uphill. Again, when splitting the nucleus, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and this means they have a tendency to split with little prompting or even spontaneously.
The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side, but 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the basalt plateau and thicker under the highlands.
In the near side, there could be more lunar maria, as the crust is thinner. Lava had an easier time rising to the surface.
Content theories fundamentally attempt to determine what inspires people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized upon reaching adulthood.
This theory examines what drives certain people to do the things they do, and what factors in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Typically, managers who start leading their former colleagues may exhibit two types of behavior. At one end of the spectrum is the effort to maintain the status of "one of the guys/girls."
Leaders of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels they need to change everything the team has done so far and turn it into their own achievement.
Ultimately, the leader is fully responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Such behavior often creates discord between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often act as a communication hub for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than typical team members, as their teams can meet according to the different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (page 109, Larson and LaFasto’s book, published in 1989) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
“The Invisible Team” is a steering committee to which each participant reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for each participant.
Why would an organization even want to invest time in such a time-consuming process of creating a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing the concept of a learning organization in practice is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process in which an organization works cohesively to overcome an obstacle can foster the creation of a new, innovative process to meet client needs.
Before an organization pursues innovation, leaders must foster a culture of innovation, as well as an organization where knowledge is shared and continuous learning takes place.
Eindžels (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher-level results.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research are supported by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes previously unseen.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to create simulation models that help us understand the processes happening in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important field of computer science that explores the ability of technology to reason, learn, and adapt intelligently.
In AI research, machines are tasked with automating tasks that require programmable action.
As examples, one could mention control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and establish diagnoses, as well as recognize handwriting, voice and face.
Things like these have become separate industries, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military field, and are also integrated into several home computer and video game software applications.
Educational excursions form a large part of the learning process. Often, a teacher would gladly take students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students, sitting with their classmates, can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art.
Sharing field trip experiences virtually is a great way to discuss the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Beneta School in North Carolina create a website about their field trip to the state capital, and each year this website is redesigned, but previous versions are preserved online as a historical archive.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often don’t pay attention to grammar and spelling when they first start blogging, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing blogs "encourages students to explore the world around them more broadly." The need to maintain reader interest motivates students to be resourceful and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Writing blog posts is a technique that fosters collaboration and motivates students to learn even outside of school hours.
Appropriate use of blogs can stimulate students to become more analytical and think critically. By actively using materials available online, students can define their own position in the context of content written by others, as well as express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital, with numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while in the north you can enjoy the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
All of that and much more gives Ontario what others consider to be the real Canada.
Vast areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and in some places there are virtually uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a surprising population comparison: the number of African Americans living in the USA is larger than the entire population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and, when it comes to wildlife, it is like a continent of its own.
The majority of smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and are also known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also introduced Islam to various lands – it took hold on a large scale in the Comoros Islands and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India around the Cape of Good Hope.
In the north, this region borders the Sahel region, and in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: it is advisable for all traveling women to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to pull out a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to situations they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon for a woman to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Don't be afraid to say no to men and reject their attention (it doesn’t matter if there are cultural differences or not, it’s still unacceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casabranca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badia, and Spanish merchants, who established trading bases there, named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
In the Medina's old town, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan crafts, such as tagines, ceramic dishes, leather goods, hookahs, and all sorts of knick-knacks, but it's all aimed solely at tourists.
Goma is a popular city with tourists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located right on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in its center.
Although Goma is sufficiently safe, all visits outside of Goma should be reviewed to understand the current state of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano and accessing some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking locations in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a “boda-boda” (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor used to denote exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main locations where Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS documentary "Wonders of the African World" was filmed.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it features more Arabic than African styles.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km², and it is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports diverse wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most important of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all national parks in South Africa, this park also has daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It might be worthwhile to purchase a “Wild Card” as well, which provides access to certain parks in South Africa or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island is where Hong Kong gets its name, and it’s a place many tourists consider a must-see destination.
The collection of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering strip, clearly highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, head away from the island to the opposite side in Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers took as their own, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are, however, not only mangrove swamps – they include some of the last remaining stands of majestic jungle growth that once covered the Gandjetik Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/marshland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that it now contains 400 royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but the majority, especially those heading east and on the Jakarta/Bumtanga routes, depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
As intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Ride-sharing taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese ngultrum) and Punakha (200 Bhutanese ngultrum).
The Ojapoka River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It stretches across the Ojapoka River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de L’Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully ready for operation in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint is scheduled.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced natural agriculture.
In the Chaco region lived other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaykurú and the Paiaguá, who subsisted on hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Paraguay, once known as the "Great Province of the Indians," emerged in the 16th century as a result of interactions between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has been able to preserve a large part of its local character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Kanjitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here several other times a year.
Find information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches on the website of the association "Asociacion Argentina de Polo".
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged at a one-to-one value with the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the “FIC West Store”.
Usually, British pounds are accepted in the islands anywhere, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the more remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency might be; ask the owners beforehand to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to find Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there is when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, the temperature usually exceeds +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively mild: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but if there's wind and humidity at the same time, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, a distance of at least 100 yards/meters must be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, moose, elk, bears, and virtually all large animals are capable of attacking.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can also be dangerous, so it’s best to keep your distance from them.
Furthermore, remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu, and its population reaches just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous 1889 maritime impasse, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for the British cruise ship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
In the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city center escalated into the assassination of the paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Thanks to Oakland's two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Coast (in the North Harbour province) are washed by the Pacific Ocean, and they stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it's safe to swim, and most offer shade from pohutukawa trees.
Takapuna Beach is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it doesn’t have a pronounced flavour, but it’s pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are more popular.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are apprehensive, bottled water is easy to find.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of 'coffee with milk'. Black coffee is called 'espresso', cappuccino is made with a huge mound of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Trips to the reef are organized year-round, but injuries due to the aforementioned reasons are rare on the reef.
However, listen to the recommendations of the authorities, pay attention to all signs, and carefully follow safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April in the northern part of the city in 1770. They are sometimes found at other times as well.
Sharks are found, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of people and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not common inhabitants of the ocean; their main distribution area is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives travelers peace of mind knowing they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although through a travel agent you have the opportunity to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold a reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer, or provide other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the majority of attendees choose to camp in tents, and most of them consider it an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the heart of the action, you need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Don't forget: even if the music on the main stage has stopped, there may be places at the festival where music will continue to play late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the buoys, as crossing the ice creates quite a disturbing noise for those most affected by this activity.
St. Petersburg cruise ships schedule time for city sightseeing. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the regulations).
Casinos generally do everything possible to keep their visitors for as long as possible and to get them to spend more money. Typically, casinos don't have windows or clocks inside, and sometimes it's difficult to find the exit.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay indoors.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the institution's expense. However, alcohol impairs judgment, and any good player knows how important it is to maintain a clear mind.
Anyone planning to drive in polar regions or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy road surfaces, there is little friction, so you cannot drive as you would on clean asphalt.
Blizzards can deposit so much snow in a very short time that it can cause congestion.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow, blizzard conditions, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, so traffic flows throughout the year mostly without interruption.
Safari trips are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most vivid adventure for many visitors.
The commonly used term "safari" refers to journeys overland to view the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, so standard equipment will allow you to view them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and can be seen better with binoculars.
A safari walk (also called a "bush walk", "safari hike" or walking "on foot") is a hike that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having also held the Games in 1964.
If you had booked flights and hotel for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have found yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus pandemic will not be extended beyond March, when the Olympic Games are planned for July 2020.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels can provide an ironing board and iron upon request if they are not available in the room.
If an iron isn’t available or you don’t like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, even melt).
There are different ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, but in others, several minutes are required.
Filters differ in their effectiveness, therefore, if you have doubts, consider buying bottled water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal parasites unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause inflammation, or, at worst, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in designated locations.
Travellers going to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch of Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions, often extending through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful – they have steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The permitted speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections of the road – typically 35–40 miles per hour (56–64 km/h) – and it is even more important to adhere to them strictly.
However, strangely enough, the mobile phone signal is much stronger here than in other stretches of the road, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German culinary products are quite enjoyable, and moreover, in Bavaria they are very filling and diverse, similar to those in neighboring Austria to the south.
Fruit buns with apple filling are available year-round, while in summer those with cherry and plum filling also appear.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and nuts from other trees. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, firm, and rich pastries, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared from meat or vegetables with the addition of herbs and spices.
Caries can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of fluid present.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine refers to the vast diversity of regional cuisines throughout the country, offering a choice from 17,000 islands.
However, without further explanation, this term generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a wide range of simple, flavorful dishes. The dominant flavors preferred by Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, hanging on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater rider stability, but can raise safety concerns as the rider's feet may become trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their foot gets caught in the saddle, the rider can be dragged along the ground if the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, several precautions must be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that allow the stirrup leathers to detach from the saddle if the rider falls and pulls on them backwards.
Kochamo Valley—Chile’s premier rock climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America—features the most diverse array of massive granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their spires. Mountaineers from all corners of the world are constantly establishing new routes on its endless rock faces.
Mountain descent sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
For many enthusiasts (sometimes called "ski bums" in English), skiing is the primary activity of their travels, and they plan all their vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated back as far as 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport originated at least in the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing – this activity is also known as cross-country touring, ski touring, or ski trekking.
It is related, but doesn’t always involve ski touring or mountaineering; in the latter case, these activities take place on steeper slopes and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking – however, you will very rarely achieve cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and a prepared track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across multiple countries would mean countless visa applications and passport controls.
However, in this regard, the Schengen area functions similarly to a single country.
While within this territory, it is generally possible to cross borders without repeated passport checks at border control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each of the Schengen member states, thus saving time, money, and effort with paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition of what manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit in places like North America might be lower than in Europe.
Crafts could be called antique items, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is essential for the Sami people to secure their livelihoods, and the culture surrounding trade is also important to representatives of many other professions.
Although not all Sami were traditionally involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather subsisted through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, they primarily utilized reindeer as working animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant source of income in the Sami-inhabited territory of Lapland.
Although the word "čigāns" is widely used, especially among people who are not of Roma ethnicity, it is often considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misrepresentation of the Roma people.
If travel advice is applied to the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
Perhaps you may want to heed the advice of another country's government, but it is intended for the citizens of those respective countries.
As one example, Americans in the Near and Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel guides provide only a brief overview of the political situation in one country.
The submitted opinions are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather refers to any dangerous natural phenomena that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Harsh weather conditions can affect any place in the world, and they can vary depending on geographical, topographical, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and consequences of destructive weather, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Harsh regional and seasonal natural phenomena include, for example, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks affecting the area, as they can impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Entering "hostile environment awareness training course" into an internet search engine will likely return the address of a local company.
In the course, all the issues discussed here are usually examined in much more detail, and practical assignments must also be completed.
The course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, various types of training on providing first aid, and sometimes also on weapons handling.
There are many and varied books and magazines about survival in extreme conditions, but there are very few publications about living in war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The government's willingness to issue passports that do not indicate gender (X), or documents updated to reflect a preferred name and gender, varies.
To a similar extent, the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents differs.
Furthermore, security checks at checkpoints have become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Trans people during the pre-operative period cannot expect their privacy and dignity to be respected when undergoing scanner checks.
Receding currents are a backwash, with waves flowing away from the beach, often towards a reef or something similar.
Thanks to the underwater topology, backflow is concentrated in some of the deepest segments, where a fast downward current can form.
In most cases, death is caused by exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, as it can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to get to a place where you won't be drawn in further, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can wait for rescuers to arrive.
Re-entry shock sets in faster than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their own culture.
Upon returning home after a life abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your homeland.
When you initially traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not realize that travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The pyramids' sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in this area for children.
Before the show begins, you can view the pyramids in darkness and silence.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here. A story of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is both the backdrop and the storyteller of a long tale.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries have territorial claims to the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases – sixteen were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the inhabited settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Livingstone Island and Deception Island remain, with the flooded caldera of an active volcano forming an impressive natural harbor.
Ellesmere Island is a region located in the south of the peninsula and is washed by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula's hills merge here into a plateau, then reappear, forming the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km long chain divided into two similar parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica – Vinson Massif – its highest peak being Vinson Mountain at an altitude of 4892 m.
In remote areas with no mobile network coverage, a satellite phone may be the only viable option.
A satellite phone isn't quite the same as a mobile phone, because to make a call you need to be outdoors and in a direct line of sight to a satellite.
The service is often used in shipping, including pleasure vessels, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
For those planning to take a study break, the opportunity to travel and learn is becoming increasingly popular.
It is particularly popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, applying for a gap year course in another country can even improve the chances of resuming higher education studies in your home country.
Typically, tuition fees will be payable for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands located in lakes or coastal archipelagos.
Yachts are not always necessary in archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for sailing any yacht, trips with smaller boats or even kayaks allow for a completely different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, as one in seven or eight residents owns a boat.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are comparable, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most diverse Baltic Sea cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that by returning and staying overnight on the ship, you can visit the historic city for a couple of days.
If you are only going ashore for excursions from the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise ship brochures mention Berlin (Germany). As you can verify on a map, the sea is nowhere near Berlin, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of any age and background, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no shame in that: it's in no way different from personal fears and dislikes towards other things, which many people experience.
Understanding how an airplane works and what happens during flight could help some overcome fears stemming from uncertainty and a lack of control.
Courier service providers have high prices for fast delivery. Often, time is the decisive factor when sending business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies had their own airplanes, but on other routes, as well as smaller companies, had to face the problem.
If they had sent the items by air freight, some routes would have taken several days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it sorted faster was to send it as registered baggage. Airline rules won't allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, then you'll need to get involved.
A surefire way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, to have your company pay for it instead).
However, it's not cheap: business class usually costs four times more than a regular economy class ticket, but first class even eleven times more!
Essentially, there's no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of higher-class air passengers who are willing to pay extra for the opportunity to reach their destination faster and fly in comfort, therefore they charge an appropriate price.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is an ethnically diverse republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, as a result of this conflict, the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic was established in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the unsuccessful political talks, economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Treat this place with all due respect, seriousness, and dignity. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface this place by marking or scratching graffiti drawings on its structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the population chooses to speak Catalan, most understand it, but practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to law.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and elsewhere.
Routine announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, however, the automated system reports unplanned disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along with Parisians is still to behave and act as a “bien élevé” (well-mannered) person. This will significantly ease your travels.
If you show a little politeness, the Parisian rudeness will quickly fade.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very forested, primarily with Norway spruces, firs, and white firs, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a wide diversity of plant communities, thanks to its varied microclimates, soil types, and altitudes above sea level.
This area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
There you can also find rare fauna such as the Eurasian brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and badger, as well as many other common species.
During the monastery visit, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must be covered.
In most monasteries, women who arrive unprepared are offered robes, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are also required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow it from the stockroom by the entrance, but that clothing isn’t washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these trousers. One size fits all men!
Mallorcan cuisine (like that of other similar Mediterranean regions) is based on bread, vegetables, and meat, especially pork, and olive oil is used everywhere.

Furthermore, pay attention to the different pronunciation of the letters 'r' and 'rr': "caro" means expensive, while "carro" means chariot.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar’s alphabet would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, nowadays people with a basic understanding of Spanish may rashly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough and doesn't need to be learned separately.
Observatories built in the past are usually outdated in modern times and are used as museums or a place for education.
Since light pollution wasn't as big a problem during the time those flowers flourished as it is now, they were usually found in cities or places that are much more accessible than those built today.
Most modern telescopes built for research are enormous structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as 'hanami', has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the Japanese apricot was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other representatives of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take “just one” specimen.
If you visit a formal garden, even collecting a “sample” will be reason enough to be asked to leave without hesitation.
Overall, Singapore is an extremely safe place, and it is very easy to get around, plus you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
However, being located "in the very tropics" just a few degrees of latitude north of the equator, you will have to endure both heat (always) and strong sunshine (if the skies are clear, which is less common).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron – the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure your intended bus goes to Hebron, and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday theme.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting places along the Danube, or travel by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also mark routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries, as well as people all over the world who are not Christian.
It is a tradition to spend Easter night awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
This tradition, of course, has Christian theological explanations, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil on the night of Easter Sunday during the Easter holiday, when gatherings, chiming at midnight, often turn into celebrations to honor the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got here by swimming, flying, or drifting with the current.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals could not reach there, therefore the giant tortoise is the main herbivore in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for more or less the entire day.
Since these areas are not densely populated and, therefore, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to stargaze.
In Japanese work culture, there is a greater degree of hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to.
