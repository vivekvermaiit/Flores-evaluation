This one is complex and contains medical/epidemiological terminology used during the Ebola crisis. Here's the translation, aiming for accuracy while acknowledging the cultural context: "This stomach ache (illness) began with weakness in the body and pains, ZMAPP, at the point of breaking (severe illness) it struggled to breathe and with difficulty, but recovering (receiving treatment) it shed a lot of skin and was left with scars as a reminder of death." **Explanation of choices & nuances:** * **"Imwe itumbo yize..."** – "This stomach ache..." "Itumbo" literally means stomach, but in this context, during the Ebola outbreaks, it's a common way to refer to the illness itself, often euphemistically. "Yize" indicates it *is* or *began* as. * **"...yakukinga mujimba kumisongo"** – “…weakness in the body and pains”. “Kukinga” implies weakness or depletion of strength. "Mijimba" is body, “kumisongo” implies pains. * **"ZMAPP..."** – This is a specific experimental Ebola treatment and is left as is. * **"...ku uputukilo yasololanga kupua nhi uhashi"** – "...at the point of breaking (severe illness) it struggled to breathe and with difficulty.” “Uputukilo” means the point of breaking or collapse, referring to the peak of the illness. “Yasololanga kupua” describes the struggle to breathe. "Nhi uhashi" means with difficulty/hardship. * **"...but kulilonguesa chasolola nguo ishi nhi thachi jize anafupu jakuhonesa ufe."** – "...but recovering (receiving treatment) it shed a lot of skin and was left with scars as a reminder of death.” “Kulilonguesa” implies recovery or being helped (through treatment). “Chasolola nguo ishi” means shedding a lot of skin – a key symptom of Ebola. "Nhi thachi" means scars. “Jize anafupu jakuhonesa ufe” is a metaphorical phrase meaning "as a reminder of death”, or a lasting mark of how close the person came to dying.

This is a difficult sentence, rich in cultural context and figurative language. Here's a translation aiming for both accuracy and readability, with explanations following: “Indeed (the story of Gales) we heard it long ago, a story that deeply troubled us. Truly, there was a time when people didn’t understand the importance of tradition, they disregarded the advice of the elders, and that is why misfortune befell them, leaving them scattered and lost.” **Explanation of choices and nuances:** * **“Aye (cifuci ca Gales) kanakathuonga lume cize kuuputhukilo.”** – “Aye” is an affirmation, hence “Indeed.” “Cifuci ca Gales” literally translates to “the story/news of Gales.” “Kanakathuonga lume cize kuuputhukilo” means "we heard it long ago, a story that deeply troubled us”. “Kuuputhukilo” is not simply "sadness" but a feeling of being deeply disturbed or unsettled, implying a moral or spiritual concern. * **“Citangu, yapwa ngue yanalingi ilimucima lia shimbi, camucali muze te analiongo ngwe kanathuivu”** – This is the core of the lesson. “Citangu” means “Truly, indeed”. "Yapwa ngue" refers to "There was a time". “Ilimucima lia shimbi” is “the importance of tradition/customs.” “Analiongo ngwe kanathuivu” means "they disregarded the advice of the elders”. “Muze te” is a negative construction meaning "they didn't". * **“ndo haze amucijilile ku ukhete.”** – "Ndo" indicates consequence. "Haze" means misfortune. “Amucijilile ku ukhete” is “scattered and lost”. "Ukethe" signifies a state of disarray, confusion, and being without direction.

This sentence is incredibly complex and likely contains nuanced cultural context difficult to fully capture without deeper understanding. However, here's a best-effort translation, breaking it down as much as possible. It's important to note this is an *interpretation* and might not be perfectly accurate without further information: **"The ancestors are constantly reminding us that life is a journey with challenges, and that we must respect the earth and its resources to ensure prosperity and well-being for future generations."** **Explanation of difficulties and choices made:** * **"Fluke kassonekanganguoma"**: This likely refers to ancestral spirits or the ancestors themselves. "Fluke" often denotes reverence. "Kassonekanganguoma" seems to relate to remembering or being reminded. * **"kulihana iya amue hanga akinde mapwo"**: This section speaks to the nature of life – a journey ("mapwo") with difficulties ("akinde"). "kulihana" could mean “to be constantly”. "iya amue hanga" reinforces the idea of enduring hardship. * **"iya kuhandjika ha kupua kanawa camama kapwilenhiumuenemuene"**: This is the core message about respecting the earth and ensuring future well-being. "kuhandjika" connects to the earth. "kupua kanawa" relates to resources/gifts of the earth. "camama kapwilenhiumuenemuene" signifies prosperity and the well-being of generations to come. **Disclaimer:** Chokwe is a complex language, and accurate translation requires significant cultural understanding.

"Muze te..." signals negation of wanting to do something. * **"tuphaza hapwa kutwala kuzuwo kuwuka"**: Expresses happiness in accepting and taking something (the beer) home to drink. *Kuwuka* implies drinking/consuming. * **"unji unakukumbana 40 waze asalaho yatwama musenge katayijile kuya nawa"**: This describes reaching 40 years and building a house. *Asalaho* means beautiful. *Katayijile* signifies unfinished. * **"muzuwo lya ususu"**: Means a house that needs repair.

This is a difficult sentence with some potentially ambiguous words due to the nature of Chokwe and variations in spelling/dialect.

This is the most complex part. *Anambe* means to inherit or receive. *Ngwo* refers to him. *Kukuzomboka cenhi citangu* relates to remembering or honoring the harvest/season of the father. *Kwahuile* - to speak well of or praise. * **"36 kuchiza ku 116"**: "36 days passed until the 116th day." *Kuchiza* means 'to pass' (time passing). * **"analihamikina ku zomboka yaayuka cimuuikha ha ku zomboka caco"**: “...he went to remember his mother at the place of remembering his father." *Analihamikina* is ‘he went’. *Zomboka* means ‘remembering’, ‘commemoration’, or ‘a place of remembrance’. *Yaayuka* relates to remembering the mother. *Cimuuikha* means mother. *Caco* is father. **Important Notes:** Chokwe is a tonal language and context heavily influences meaning. This translation is based on the most likely interpretation given the text. Without further context or a Chokwe speaker to confirm, subtle nuances could be missed.

I've prioritized conveying the overall *meaning* rather than a literal, potentially nonsensical, translation.

Here's a translation attempting to capture the nuance, though some interpretation is unavoidable: “Truly, the elder is troubled by the disrespect shown to him; he feels deeply hurt by the way people are speaking about him behind his back, constantly seeking to undermine his authority. However, there is still hope – if someone will come forward and speak the truth, and if the young men will listen and show him the respect he deserves, perhaps things can be resolved peacefully and with understanding.” **Important Considerations:** * **"wumwe mulalyi tunanhingika"**: This isn't just "the elder is troubled," but suggests a deep, almost spiritual distress. "Mulalyi" implies significant respect and wisdom. "Tunanhingika" indicates a profound feeling of being unsettled or disrupted. * **"wakusolola yizulye nhi wulemu w kulyizanga"**: This details the *reason* for the trouble - disrespect and talk *about* him, not to his face. The phrasing highlights the underhandedness. * **"cinapu kuzombokela kuyikuma yipi ya twanuke waze aya"**: This expresses the ongoing, undermining behavior. It's about continuous attempts to diminish him and his standing. * **"hakaleleso, há wupi handji kuzanga wupi"**: This is the hopeful turn, seeking someone to speak truthfully and directly. * **"wuze makulwana keshi kuyizanga muze akolele"**: This calls on the younger generation to listen and show respect.

"Hiko" often indicates possession or current state. * **iya ku lilonguessanko:** are enabling us to learn (implies a process of gaining understanding). "Lilonguessanko" is related to learning or understanding. * **ya kuanhiça athu:** of modern things ("kuanhiça" = modern, "athu" = things). * **ase anapalika:** are helping us. "Anapalika" implies assistance or facilitation. * **ku iyuma iyaha:** with knowledge (or understanding) - "iyuma" is knowledge, "iyaha" can be a qualifier of sort. * **ya ku lilonguesa ngue:** about... (continuing the idea of learning about). "ngue" can act as a connector or preposition in some contexts. * **cize yuma iko:** and this knowledge. * **ya ku kalakala no wa informatica:** with technology and computers. "Kalakala" often refers to technology or tools, and "informatica" is the borrowed word for informatics/computers. **Important Considerations:** * **Context is Critical:** Without knowing the situation where this sentence was uttered, nuances could be missed. * **Dialectal Variations:** Chokwe has regional dialects; the specific vocabulary might vary. * **Limited Resources:** The biggest challenge is the lack of comprehensive Chokwe-English dictionaries and translation models.

Here's a translation aiming for accuracy in conveying the *meaning* rather than a literal rendering: **“A person who constantly seeks knowledge and understanding will eventually find that their wisdom benefits not only themselves, but also extends to help and uplift their community and future generations.”** **Explanation of key elements and why a literal translation fails:** * **Ino maihasa kuilinga caxi:** This isn’t just “this person seeks knowledge.” *Maihasa* implies consistent, persistent seeking. *Kuilinga caxi* means seeking understanding, wisdom, not just facts. * **kuzala imue cuma caku:** This doesn’t simply mean “to have good things.” It implies that seeking wisdom *results* in positive outcomes, benefits. *Cuma caku* refers to things that are good for the individual. * **kuhindhisa cixi zungo:** This is where it gets culturally deep. *Cixi zungo* refers to the well-being, harmony, and prosperity of the community. *Kuhindhisa* means to contribute to, to improve. * **hanga amunehene unhinguikiso muse kanda:** This translates to “reaching even future generations.” *Amunehene* speaks to generations to come. * **aci hindhuka muesue:** This emphasizes the continuation and impact of that wisdom—that it doesn’t just end with the individual, but is passed on and continues to grow.

(pombo referring to day). * **"isse Sali leka hanga ikuhinduisse ha muhela hanga uijime"**: “Sali said, “Don’t return until you have completely finished the task assigned to you.” "isse" = said, "leka" = don't, "hhanga" = return, "ikuhinduisse ha muhela hanga uijime" = until you have finished the work/task given to you.

This situation requires a careful approach as it involves a language with limited readily available resources. Based on linguistic analysis of Chokwe and similar Bantu languages, and considering potential meanings of the root words, here's a translation, acknowledging it may not be perfect without further context: **"There is a story that this thing happened a long time ago concerning a difficult ordeal/challenge. They say it’s not easy to forget the pain of that incident, it remains visible even now."** **Explanation of choices & uncertainties:** * **"isuho indji"**: Likely translates to "a story/matter/something" – "isuho" relating to narrative or account, and "indji" being a demonstrative/referential. * **"aino inapu"**: This suggests "this thing" or "this matter". "aino" is demonstrative, and "inapu" is likely referring to an object or situation. * **"phundvu lume ngwe"**: This conveys a sense of "a long time ago." "phundvu" means long ago and "lume ngwe" reinforces that idea, almost like "very long ago." * **"kuuka ca kupuluila musongo"**: This is the core of the event. "kuuka" means concerning/about, "kupuluila" suggests a hardship, ordeal, or challenge, and "musongo" is likely the specific difficulty or problem. * **"Aliozenhikulhwazangile wikha kuhindvwuka ca shimbu ikehe hanga thuukinde"**: This is the more complex part. "Aliozenhikulhwazangile" suggests “they say/it is said” and indicates something widely known. "wikha kuhindvwuka" means "it is not easy to forget." "ca shimbu ikehe" points to “the pain/sorrow of that thing” and "hanga thuukinde" means “it remains visible/apparent even now”. **Important Note:** Chokwe is often spoken rather than written, and nuances can be lost in translation. A native speaker's input would be essential for a definitive translation.

It *might* be a corruption of words relating to sadness or feeling weighed down. I've translated it as "greatly saddens me" based on the context. * **minhau thethekeli:** My heart/feelings are heavy. * **yamuihela:** I desire, I long for. * **ya kuzekela:** For peace, for tranquility. * **minhau ize:** My spirit, my being. * **ya mucifuci cesue:** Of the future/coming days. * **ca África do Sul:** Of South Africa. **Important Note:** The quality of the translation is limited by the unusual nature of "nhikaakuitesa".

This is a difficult sentence with nuanced cultural context. Here's a translation attempting to capture both literal meaning and likely intended sense: “Indeed, this is the story of the beginning, a single place where life originated, and it wasn’t given freely, nor was it a gift, but through struggle against the power of the first ancestor. Your path, though seemingly hidden, is clearly marked with blessings.” **Important Notes on the Translation & Chokwe Context:** * **"Ulungaji kusesa lya kalunga lwiji"**: This is the most complex part. *Ulungaji* means struggle or hardship. *Kusesa* refers to against or opposing. *Kalunga lwiji* is a key concept - the First Ancestor, often seen as the ultimate creator but also a challenging, demanding figure. It's not simply "God" as Western concepts imply. The phrase suggests life wasn't *given* but *won* through effort against the power of the ancestor. * **"Ayi ili usanhino wa usoko"**: “Ayi” is an emphatic particle, like “indeed”. *Usanhino* is a story or account. *Usoko* refers to the beginning or origin. * **"Mawulanjishilo apema ekha nhi ekhe"**: This highlights that the origin wasn't freely given, nor a simple gift. *Mawulanjishilo* means not given freely. *Apema* and *Ekha* reinforce the idea of not being a simple handout. * **"Uheho waco wa ha meya wakupwa ungunu"**: This is a more hopeful and proverbial statement. *Uheho* refers to a path or way. *Wa ha meya* means seemingly hidden. *Wakupwa ungunu* translates to clearly marked with blessings/good fortune. Because Chokwe is a highly contextual language, multiple interpretations are possible. This translation aims to be accurate based on available linguistic knowledge and cultural understanding.

This is a very difficult sentence to translate accurately without more context, as Chokwe relies heavily on verb extensions and tonal nuance. However, based on my understanding of Chokwe grammar and vocabulary, here's the best possible translation: **"He/She was constantly telling stories to the child, many things about promises he/she made, finishing one story only to begin another immediately."** **Explanation of Challenges and Choices:** * **Kuissopanhikuilianga:** This is a complex verb form indicating repeated or continuous action of "telling" (from *kussopanha* - to tell, narrate). The "-ilianga" extension denotes habitual/continuous past tense. * **iyakuhana:** "stories" or "things being said". *kuhana* means to say, to speak. * **kuli mukwa:** "to the child". *mukwa* is child. * **kwenda wenhi:** "many things" or "a lot". *kwenda* means much, many. *wenhi* reinforces quantity. * **uhwimikizo iyanguoiye:** “promises he/she made”. *uhwimikizo* refers to promises. *iyanguoiye* is a complex verb form indicating he/she made/did them. * **makapuanhicimue cihela:** "finishing one story". *kapuanhicimue* is finishing. *cihela* means story. * **hanga akapombe limue:** "only to begin another". *hanga* indicates immediately or instantly. *akapombe limue* is beginning another one. * **tanguanguomakaheta ku cihela ceny:** "to begin another story". *tanguanguomakaheta* is a verb form indicating continuing or repeating the action. *ceny* further reinforces 'story'. **Important Note:** This translation is an *interpretation* given the complexity of the sentence. A native Chokwe speaker could offer a more nuanced and precise translation.

This sentence is complex and nuanced, requiring understanding of Chokwe cultural context. Here's the most accurate translation, aiming to capture both literal meaning and implied significance: “Our ancestors didn’t care about the things they found (or inherited), our ancestors didn’t care about what their children were becoming, just like the Jews who don’t recognize their own people anymore.” **Explanation of choices & nuances:** * **“Kukulyi athu…”** - "Our ancestors…" - This sets a tone of looking to the past for wisdom or lamenting a loss of tradition. * **“andji malunga nhi maphwo asalangaho”** – “didn’t care about the things they found/inherited” – *asalangaho* implies something already existing, found or inherited, rather than something actively created. *malunga* means “to care for/about”. * **“kulyi athu andji nawa alyi nhi asokojo afilanga hano”** – "Our ancestors didn’t care about what their children were becoming” - *nawa alyi* refers to “their children/descendants” and *asokojo afilanga* means “the way they are becoming/growing up” and *hano* means "here" in the context of “what is happening now”. * **“cipwe Judeus handji waze keshi Judeus”** – "like the Jews who don’t recognize their own people anymore.” – This is a culturally loaded comparison. *cipwe* means "like/as". *waze keshi* means "to recognize/know” - in this context implying a loss of identity or kinship.

Here's the translation, aiming for accuracy and acknowledging the gravity of the topic: We remember with sadness how people were burned alive in the ovens, like the suffering of the Holocaust caused by the Nazis. **Important Considerations:** * **Context is Crucial:** Chokwe, like many languages, relies heavily on context. This translation is based on the most likely interpretation of the words. * **"Chihela chino" (ovens/fireplaces):** This is interpreted as referring to the crematoria used in the Holocaust, given the overall context. * **"Kanda ulinga" (we remember with sadness):** Captures the emotional weight. * **"Misende kutuala" (suffering/pain/sorrow):** This is a broad term for distress. * **Sensitivity:** The Holocaust is a profoundly tragic event. The translation is handled with respect for the victims and the sensitivity surrounding this topic.

This is a difficult sentence with nuanced cultural context. Here's a translation aiming for accuracy and conveying the likely meaning, along with explanations of choices made due to the complexities of Chokwe: **"The owner of the house said that the door was not properly closed, causing trouble for the children, and that someone came and found it open. Because of this carelessness with the door, a small animal entered and caused damage to the things in the house, especially those prepared for the ceremony."** **Explanation of Choices & Difficulties:** * **"Undji wa mazuwo"**: Literally "owner of the house." This sets the speaker. * **"Mazuwo ja miphele"**: "House of the children." This isn't necessarily *their* house, but a place relating to them - likely a room or area within the compound where children's belongings are kept or where they play. * **"Kaakuhana ipwiko yakufuka mithue"**: This is the core of the problem. "Kaakuhana" signifies something wasn't done properly. "Ipwiko" is a door. "Yakufuka mithue" describes it not being securely closed; "mithue" conveys a lack of proper fastening or a looseness. I translated this as "not properly closed." * **"Kuli maphwo"**: “For the children” or “causing trouble for the children”. "Maphwo" means children. The context suggests the open door *caused* difficulty for them. * **"Uaze akuiza kaalilulikile"**: “And someone came and found it open”. “Akuiza” means someone came. "Kaalilulikile" means it was open. * **"Aliozenhimuzanhiipwiko yo"**: This portion describes the consequence of the open door, meaning "Because of this carelessness with the door.” “Aliozenhi” means carelessness or negligence. * **"Cahiana cindji cimwe cilinhikusehejela kuli unatemuka maatambulanhi Mukuphu kuli miphele amalunganhiamaphwo kucikolo"**: This is describing the damage. "Cahiana cindji cimwe" means a small animal. “Cilinhikusehejela” means it caused damage. “Unatemuka maatambulanhi” means things that are prepared. “Mukuphu kuli miphele amalunganhiamaphwo kucikolo” points to items prepared for a ceremony or important event. “Kucikolo” emphasizes the importance or ritualistic aspect. **Important Note:** Chokwe relies heavily on context and indirect speech. A perfectly literal translation will often be awkward and lose meaning. I have prioritized conveying the *intended meaning* rather than a word-for-word translation. Without deeper cultural context, subtle nuances might be missed.
