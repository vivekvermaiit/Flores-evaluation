Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and chair of the clinical and scientific section of the Canadian Diabetes Association, cautioned that the research is still in its early stages.
Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured and points out that these results are not relevant to people who already have type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, Sara Danius, publicly announced during a radio program on Swedish Radio that the committee had been unable to reach Bob Dylan directly regarding the reception of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, and that it had therefore given up its attempts to contact him.
Danius said, "Right now we’re not doing anything. I’ve called and emailed his closest colleagues and received very friendly responses. That will certainly have to be enough for the time being."

The USA Gymnastics federation supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and agrees that it is absolutely necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs are better served by moving forward with a meaningful change to our organization than by removing the certification.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse of such proportions as that so courageously described by survivor Larry Nassar could have gone undetected for so long, and welcomes necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.
Throughout the entire 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and subsequently for Lyndon B. Johnson's administration.
During the 1976 election, he was a foreign policy advisor for Carter, and later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, succeeding Henry Kissinger.
Just as the NSA assisted Carter in the diplomatic handling of world affairs, such as the Camp David Accords of 1978; the normalization of relations between the USA and China in the late 1970s; the Iranian Revolution, which led to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal’s plumage was chestnut-brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, so-called rachis, but do possess other characteristics of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The feather structure indicates they weren’t used for flight but instead for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested the specimen shows adult plumage and not downy feathers, although the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers argued that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not juvenile down.
A car bomb that detonated near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun functioned according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Using brightness and rotation, a star's Rossby number is determined, which relates to plasma flows.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

He added that "they should, however, not be expected to assume obligations that go beyond their level of development, responsibility, and capabilities."
The Iraq study group presented its report at 12:00 today.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this time will stop sectarian warfare, escalating violence, or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins with a plea for an open discussion and consensus in the US regarding Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive branch’s current policy toward Iraq and requests an immediate change of course.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year, to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile interventions, and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the research team was looking for would be caused by forces resembling tides in the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts gravitational pull on Earth, which causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The researchers succeeded in establishing that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of a multitude of small particles.
TV broadcasts show white smoke coming from the facility.
Local authorities are urging residents in the area around the power plant to stay indoors, turn off their air conditioning, and not drink the tap water.

Doctor Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, believes Doctor Moll, at least two of whom were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it appears that the proportion with XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis remains low: 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day likely indicate they are caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it aligns with the idea that these are deep holes in the ground,” says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) team for astrogeology and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot with their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After election officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the ballot envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the procedure rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no ballots inside at the start of voting and that no ballots are added except those duly accounted for from eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision and follow specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 total giant slalom competitors failed to place in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Vice Chief Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services cut the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused in Edinburgh's sheriff court of murdering his son.
She is being held in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but all eyewitness testimony could become worthless as her image has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in Great Britain, but Scottish law functions differently and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee states that "journalists are taking a dangerous path if they publish pictures etc. of suspects."
The prosecution office, which has overall responsibility for bringing charges, has told journalists that no further comments will be made before an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document concerns the border dispute, where Palestinians want the borders to be based on those before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly being discussed are the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a ten-year continuous military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only approves of leaving such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by the park rangers, as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting assignment received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous interim electoral council resign, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The partially violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been postponed since 2011.
Reports have emerged of approximately 60 cases where faulty iPods have overheated, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "minor."
The department responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The office of the North Marianas Rescue Service reported that no injuries have been reported in the country.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained to become an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that the government investigators recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died under the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I am... maybe even bigger... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's doing better where she is now."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view, that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three relay races, at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his ailments, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to overcome his pain as it is prohibited in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth’s water resources, along with organic material that could form proteins and sustain life.
Because comets collided with Earth a long time ago, researchers hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, assumed office earlier this year and last month signed a bill into law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean planes fly shorter distances, save millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport will be provided, trains above ground will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published last Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin’s finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the introduced Spanish Darwin’s finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together. Then, form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a huge rocket over 30 meters tall to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest contribution of the wheel is that it has given us much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret behind their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job for each cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all big cats, and live in large groups called prides.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and young.
The goddesses are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leopards behave much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar isn't like the lion's loud roaring, but more like a meaning made of growls, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they migrate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they often end up in a different environment than the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so to be a strong competitor the new population needs different traits or adaptations than those it needed before.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans release (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were lined with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Even though the majority of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual delicacies such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the wealthy men preferred to have banquets together where they could recline on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests attempted to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests had access to.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The tower's top was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Most of the Hebrew family’s life took place outdoors.
Women cooked food on the farm; shops were simply counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the Land of Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Nordic sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he travelled west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Even though each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776” were written. The text appears on the underside of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the “Vichy” French. These were French people who had agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, which also in a way defines the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge between generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked all power to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it fell to the state governments, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its decisions.
It also lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added, and the states placed so little importance on the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 6th largest island country in the world! **(Note: The original Swedish stated 7th largest *island*, but it's more accurate and commonly understood as 6th largest *island country*.)**
With its many islands, Japan is geographically often considered an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the original production of grain, employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
Following the defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more importantly is its aspect ratio, which has been inherited by the formats of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS format) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It is claimed that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had united European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power influenced everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s funds are intended for precisely that purpose.
The Church’s central power had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the conflict erupted, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated widely accepted international law as codified in numerous international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral vessels.
Since they had received a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most people and countries was pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation repeating itself in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to begin working at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China’s history, or each family that held power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability where the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms, which took place over the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to ascend to the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as rank within the army was now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to revolt.
Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave, which is located on one of the mountaintops north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, there is complete isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid of Giza was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
The mark for "upstroke" looks like a V and the mark for "downstroke" like a bracket or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow downwards.
An upstroke typically generates a softer sound, while a downstroke is stronger and more resolute.
You are welcome to add your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed phrasing markings are there for a musical reason, and should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madam Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, one of the mob participants swung the head of an imperial guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The costs of the American empire's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the large profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the foundational profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the order's creation.
The time period when these events took place is often called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history from the 11th to the 13th centuries.
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing many different ideas in practice, ranging from technology driving development or the technological imperative, to the strict notion that humanity’s fate is driven by a fundamental logic inherent in the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a trajectory largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has “effects” on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the motor-driven car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically sustainable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new technologies within healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a strong element of determinism originating with authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture arose related to this geography, and these, harmonizing with the location of the community, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 AD and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
Its influence declined in the 14th century, primarily due to the fact that Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was around this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication routes, however, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or they can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Such children are called "feral." Some feral children have been confined by people (most often their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child’s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are reported to have lived in the wilderness entirely on their own.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the specific nurturing animal, such as its fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, remedial teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but a support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is integrated into the software and is designed to challenge, guide, and explain methods that the student may have found too difficult to manage independently.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that isn’t nurturing, caring, or educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are meant to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home they came from previously.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The internet's distinct characteristics lead to further dimensions regarding user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Even “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions that last only a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks demonstrated in his writing ""The President’s Speech"" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge sincerity.
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research during the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two poles with each new generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human's to satisfy its need for amino acids from the available plants.
Furthermore, a lack of this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
As a comparison, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also offers high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids.
When all is said and done, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10–60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you tend to turn off your alarm while sleepy, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which causes you to have to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates inversely with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded with the path of loving-kindness within Mahayana and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
God yoga is central to Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. When the war ended, differences in systems, processes, and culture caused the countries’ cooperation to fall apart.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would unfold over the next 40 years and would be fought physically through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and simultaneously violating the Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The overwhelmingly most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships for transporting cargo.
The traditional job of navies has been to ensure your country maintains the ability to transport its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated first around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Wild boar were typically kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were frequently children or young people, similar to the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve higher speeds and haul greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the rails in place. However, people gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This came to be standard practice, but the iron wore the wooden wheels of the wagons down more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails made entirely of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man") first appeared.
Their predecessors, australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often just symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is with all due clarity apparent that the world has changed greatly due to humanity’s scientific and technological advancements, and problems have worsened due to overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap’s printing shop a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the farm in Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 broadsides by Dunlap known to still exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many features in birds that still resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary digits.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning isn't always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning could be an open container of medicine or poisonous household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "baggar" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from an ancient relationship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize humans.
Both carpet beetles and bed bugs are house pests, adapted to live in the dwelling of their host.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or for the best of their children, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is guiding in almost all research.
However, it is not alone. Experimenting – where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses – asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific questions, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that repeats its cycle over a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that labeled either the DNA in the substance with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited by offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns in cars to go to work, and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in some way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private car ownership.
Science now shows that this massive fossil fuel economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. Virtually everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaint, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because driver behaviors cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic tends to flow relatively consistently and can largely be presented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are helpful in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite—that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times greater than that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, 9 km wide in places.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main channel is 6,387 km. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has around 800 inhabitants. It is the world’s smallest independent country and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories about them changing into new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances like calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion to many people when it was first released.
As newer writing methods have developed, the pencil has unfortunately lost status and has fewer applications.
Today, people write messages on computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer arrives.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to create a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Roughly like rolling a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and it doesn't take much for them to decay.
The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the moon-harbors and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around discovering what motivates people or what appeals to them.
The theories posit that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what drives some people to want what they want and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain "one of the guys/girls."
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, carry out disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, delegate responsibility, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams maintain the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members, as different time zones can affect when their team can meet, and this may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a truly “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? A goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows and makes the field of research much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, illnesses, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we haven't seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us understand processes in our minds.
Even though AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch within computer science that encompasses machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
Research in AI is about enabling machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been integrated into several home computers and TV game software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in every grade. Often, the teacher wants to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital every year; the website is redesigned annually, but previous versions remain online as an archive.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students' writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, but the presence of readers generally improves this.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also “forces students to become more aware of the world around them.” The requirement to satisfy readers’ interests stimulates students to be quick-witted and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums showcasing Canada's present and past.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, and in the northern part you'll find the beautiful, pristine nature of Muskoka.
All of this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right when it comes to fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a significant impact in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 1400s after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, thereby discovering the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It’s good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men, and don’t be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don’t make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of knick-knacks, but it’s all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located far to the east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the central areas.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you plan to visit areas outside of Goma, you should investigate the situation regarding the fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as offering some of the cheapest gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its renown makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat from desert sand.
It was one of the major highlights during Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which harbors diverse wildlife.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Just like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which either grants access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong territory its name and is the place many tourists consider the main focus.
The buildings lined up that make up Hong Kong’s skyline have been likened to a glittering bar chart, amplified by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the buildings on Hong Kong Island are densely packed on former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took over, so if you are looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world and extends 80 km inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps—they contain some of the last remaining stands of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third consists of wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district’s common bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it's a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two walkways that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as "India's giant province," was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups from the native indigenous population.
The Spanish initiated the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having polo teams and players among the best in the world.
This year's biggest tournament takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets to polo matches, please contact the Argentinian Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the value of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley it is often possible to pay with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards are likely not to be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency can be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It's practically impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
However docile they may appear, bison, moose, caribou, bears, and almost all large animals can become aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking strongly scented food and keep your campsite clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two harbors. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore’s beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of them, Māori myrtle offers shade.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes popular family beaches with a good selection of shops located by the beach. Swimming is safe.
The premier local beer is "Number one," which isn't a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines might travel better.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the concept of a “flat white” coffee is unknown. A “short black” is “espresso”, cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The warm chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef year-round, and damage due to any of these causes to the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, heed the authorities’ advice, obey all signs, and be very attentive to safety warnings.
Jellyfish occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even package holidays combining flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or gather any additional documents required for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things are happening, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival may continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as traveling through ice causes truly terrible sounds for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing can occur.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snow squalls, or through condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to journeys across the land to see the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk" and "hiking safari") involves hiking for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies due to the coronavirus vary, but by the end of March, most didn’t extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to begin.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if it’s not in the room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is handy.
Be careful and don't let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while others require several minutes.
Filters can vary in effectiveness, and if you are unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people with violence, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods without tax or other additional charges in certain locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often running through remote wilderness terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, drive with caution: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
Posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – typically 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) – and adhering to them is even more important than usual.
Surprisingly, the mobile coverage is much better here than along many other stretches, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really delicious, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those from its southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked into pastries year-round and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what, depending on the region, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and Pakistan's inland regions, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name encompassing a wide variety of regional dishes scattered throughout the country.
But if used without a determiner, the term tends to refer to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a wealth of simply seasoned dishes, where the flavorings most commonly used by Javanese people are peanuts, chili, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but remains caught in the stirrup with one foot, they can be dragged if the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders have boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that ensure a stirrup detaches from the saddle if pulled backwards by a rider who falls off.
Cochamó Valley, Chile’s premier climbing destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain peaks offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain faces.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you glide down a snow-covered landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called “ski bums,” who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport has existed at least since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also called backcountry ski touring, ski touring, or ski wandering.
It is related to, but usually doesn't involve, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as you would a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to manage a greater distance than when walking – but you will rarely reach speeds comparable to cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control on numerous occasions.
However, the Schengen Area functions approximately like one country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without undergoing passport controls repeatedly.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen member country. This saves you both time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where age limits may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, even though they aren't as old as comparable mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many with other professions.
However, historically not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and used reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Even though it is often used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation protection may be affected.
You can also have a desire to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own citizens.
For example, different circumstances may apply to American citizens in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advisory is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often hasty, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Difficult weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, droughts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include heavy blizzards, snow squalls, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather impacting their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "hostile environment training" will likely give you the address of a local company.
A course typically covers all the topics mentioned here, but in much more detail, often with practical exercises.
A course typically lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books about how to survive in the wilderness, while books dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports without a specified gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Searches during security checks have also become considerably more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to be able to pass through airport security with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves breaking off the shore, often at a reef or similar structure.
The underwater topography causes the backflow to be concentrated in a few deeper areas, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most fatalities occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you won’t get stuck again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been discovered, wait to be rescued.
Return shock hits sooner than culture shock (there’s less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes struggle to readjust to their original culture.
Upon returning from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, due to the knowledge that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness, and you can see them in silence before the performance begins.
Typically, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a fairytale.
The background is formed by the Sphinx, who tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula’s mountains merge here with the plateau and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica’s highest mountain, Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by vessels, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telecommunications operator should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
Typically, a fee is charged to register for these educational programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of age or background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There’s no shame in it: it’s no different from the personal fear and aversion to other things that many people experience.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear stemming from discomfort with the unknown or from a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own airplanes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they have shipped items by air freight, it may have taken several days to clear unloading and customs on certain routes.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules don’t allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no point in even looking for discounted fares for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. The airlines also charge accordingly.
Moldova's capital is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any of the member states of the UN.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in the political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The city, historically known as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a vibrant commercial center located at a vast harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble statues of doves above some of the graves.
It's worth wandering around for half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach to the north lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a glowing account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the fantastic Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place world-renowned for apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site and a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death here – Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the website with the great dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scratching graffiti on structures.
Barcelona's official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the primary official language according to law.
Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other institutions, however.
Regular announcements on the subway are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to conduct yourself with the utmost politeness and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). It will make getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians’ brusque exterior will quickly disappear if you show your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forest, mainly beech, spruce and silver fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably high biodiversity, due to the extent of microclimates, diverse soils, and varying altitude differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and black grouse can be found there, along with many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers the knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide shawls to women who haven’t prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men should have to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stockroom in the entrance, but the garments aren't washed after each person, so you might not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and consistently uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as “Sie” for the pronoun “you” (formal), are capitalized, even mid-sentence.
This is an important method for distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes reading easier, although the need to figure out whether a verb or adjective is in noun form makes the writing slightly more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help learning a lot about Persian grammar and understanding sentences better if you read this basic grammar textbook.
It will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
But people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution during their heyday wasn't the kind of problem it is today, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remotely located places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the viewing of cherry blossoms, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where they used plum blossoms.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If you visit a landscaped garden, and you pick a “specimen,” it will also get you kicked out, no discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
But with its location in the “high tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you must deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a smaller number of buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives rest.
Check that the bus you are considering taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a tour along the Göta Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays within Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil mass on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend. At midnight, the congregation then breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by either swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to reach the islands, and therefore the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived on the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar nights, meaning the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners might be used to.
A suit is the standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with emphasis placed on collective efforts rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without hesitation.
