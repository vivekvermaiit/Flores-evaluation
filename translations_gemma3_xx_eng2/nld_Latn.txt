In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the teleshopping channel QVC.
Ring also reached a settlement in a lawsuit with ADT Corporation. That is a competing security company.
One experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing Ebola mortality, but so far, no medications have clearly proven effective for treating existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed much promise in the field. However, official studies showed it had fewer benefits than desired in preventing people from dying.
ZMapp was a control in the PALM trial, so scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatment methods to it.
The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands that it is necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We align with the USOC’s statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to implement meaningful changes within our organization rather than withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuse on this scale, so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s victims, could remain undetected for so long, and embraces all necessary and applicable changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal: ensuring that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment by making the sport of gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked as an advisor to John F. Kennedy and subsequently for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.
He advised Carter on foreign policy during the 1976 elections. He then succeeded Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor (NSA), a position he held from 1977 to 1981.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, as dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do possess other feather characteristics – such as barbules.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flying, but to regulate temperature or for display. The researchers suggested this was the tail of a young dinosaur, but this specimen actually shows fully developed feathers and therefore isn’t the down of a hatchling.
The researchers suggested that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen had the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded near the main police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

Commons administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his frustrations about the deletion during his conversation with Wikinews last month.
He [Wales] was essentially lying to us from the start. First, by pretending it was for legal reasons. Second, by just pretending to listen to us, until he had the artwork removed.
The frustrations within the community have resulted in current efforts to develop a policy regarding the sexual content of the site, which hosts millions of pieces of openly licensed media content.
The completed work was primarily theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the Milky Way.
Similar to how the moon exerts a force on Earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around it, in a kind of ring, and consists of a large number of smaller particles.

XDR-TB (Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant is 'very disturbing and worrying due to the very high mortality rate'.
Doctor Moll believes some patients contracted the illness in the hospital, including two healthcare workers from the hospital.
An infected person can potentially infect 10 to 15 close contacts within a year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all tuberculosis patients still seems relatively low: 6,000 out of 330,000 infected people in total at any given time in South Africa.

“Its thermal behavior isn’t as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature. What *is* consistent is that they are deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting traditionally requires very little technology: voters go into a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope indicating which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the voter's identity. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then signs the voters' roll.
The process is relatively strictly defined in French electoral law.
Ballot boxes have been required to be transparent since 1988, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no envelopes other than those from registered and authorized voters are added.
The candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four skiers from the women's seated slalom group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to qualify during the race.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone have been recovered by the police of Madhya Pradesh.
According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the perpetrators who raped the Swedish woman have been arrested, and her mobile phone and laptop have been recovered.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit it, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver did sustain serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering her son.
She is being held in custody awaiting charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may be deliberately misleading as her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently and courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office has overall responsibility for prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges are filed.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute resolution mechanism, something the Palestinians desired based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, a city holy to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA is only willing to allow a presence of five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the trial was being followed and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association’s game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four selected shooters received comprehensive safety and training instruction before the first shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the previous National Electoral Council. This is part of a package of measures to ensure new elections are held in the country.
The commission was established by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests arose due to the lack of elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases have been reported of defective iPods overheating. This resulted in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company described as 'not serious'.
“Very regrettable,” was the ministry’s response to the fact that Apple had postponed the report.
Mariana was struck by the earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday 21:19 GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning in effect.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety, and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went into medicine, following in his father’s footsteps.
Having trained as a midwife, he began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins conducted research on premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs in babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government researchers recovered two “black boxes” – flight recorders – on Wednesday.
Colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna passed away on a night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman.'
Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels stated that 'Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place'.
Of the 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end of the spectrum, 31 percent said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and three relay races during the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to alleviate his pain because it was banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are formed. They are particularly interested in finding out how Earth originated, considering it has been a very long time since comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours 'political nonsense and chatter'.
It is speculated that he intends to run for president in 2016.
With the NextGen system, aircraft could take shorter routes according to the FAA, potentially saving millions of tons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, unlike older technologies with ground radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much more accurately and provide pilots with clearer information.
No extra transport is being deployed and no above-ground trains will be stopping at Wembley; additionally, the parking lots and Park & Ride facilities are inaccessible on site.
A potential lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the match would be played behind closed doors and without fans.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was previously thought that this process took much longer because the interbreeding of a native Darwin's finch, the Medium Ground Finch, with an immigrated Cactus Finch, the Española Ground Finch, took longer.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a fine thread that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into sheets.
After being made very thin, it can be stuck onto another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You are already making an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Subsequently, the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acidic to basic or alkaline) of the chemical substance.
The pH value is indicated based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands, and form a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to an advanced drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, toilets already existed in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia. During the time of the Romans, toilets were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen gathered together in a mixed group.
When you call someone who is located thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately sent back.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need an enormous rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has incredibly changed the world. The most important thing it has given us is easier and faster transportation.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport are the result of that here.
There are medium-sized felines among them that prey on medium-sized animals, from hares to antelopes and deer.
Moreover, there are many small cats (such as free-roaming cats kept as pets) that hunt smaller prey in larger numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has, preventing them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and can also include up to thirty females and pups.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves very similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats), and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump large distances, and has five times the pulling strength of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
A tiger doesn't roar with full force like a lion. It's more as if it growls an entire sentence.
Ocelots’ favorite meals are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can. The ocelot almost exclusively hunts animals much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They can see and move around very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population they originated from (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies appear, so the new population must behave differently or adapt in order to be able to face the competition.
Because they still require the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to resemble the other population less and less.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation and simply involves the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Through photosynthesis, plants obtain their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our homes and clothes are made from plants. We primarily eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain of that time. It had nothing to fear from anyone, except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws held more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing and no one could escape him.
It isn't certain, but it’s possible his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and perhaps even members of its own species.
In bodies of water, nothing was safe from his attacks either; even colossal dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although the majority of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
In addition, there was another difference: poor people and women sat on chairs during meals, but wealthy men preferred to hold banquets where they lounged on their sides while eating.
Meals from the Roman era did not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was considered to be the god's own home.
Offers were brought to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a public courtyard and an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were no more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, and therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland had few inhabitants at the time. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland while traveling west, and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although they were all ‘Scandinavian’ countries, the people, the royal family, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different from each other.
Perhaps after watching the film National Treasure you might think there’s a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That, however, is based on a misunderstanding. There is something written on the back, but it’s not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is certain who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was previously rolled up for storage.
It seems that the designation was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was governed by Vichy France. These were French people who sided with the Germans in 1940 and thus collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated Southern France in just two weeks. After that, they set off towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin *civilis*, meaning civic, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin *civis*, which in turn denotes a citizen, and *civitas*, which signifies a city or city-state; and that, in a certain way, also defines the format of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through multiple generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, and therefore are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of a congress.
The congress lacked the power to levy taxes, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, and for the implementation of all decisions it relied on state authorities who were often unwilling to cooperate.
It also lacked the authority to override state tax laws and rates.
Initially, all states had to unanimously approve the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government very seriously, resulting in their representatives often being absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team worldwide and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are especially popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest). This makes Japan the 63rd largest island country in the world. (Note: The original Dutch stated 7th largest *island*, which is incorrect. Japan is the 63rd largest *island country*.)
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often geographically referred to as a 'peninsula'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed past the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established itself in southwestern Taiwan as a base of operations, where it intervened in indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in the year 1885.
Following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Composed of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings around the perimeter of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of how they used to look.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. The renovation is still ongoing.
For example, the most common image format for still images worldwide is 35mm, which was the standard film format towards the end of the analog film era.
These are still produced today, although it was primarily the aspect ratio that the image sensor of the digital camera adopted.
Strangely enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, with a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) would be 3:2.
Many common layouts (such as APS-like layouts) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes an image dynamic, yet still clear.
The most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. To do this, divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power influenced everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church therefore has financial resources available.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin to doubt whether this principle was being upheld.
Great Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to deliver vital supplies to soldiers and civilians. However, this blockade did violate generally accepted international law, which had been established over the past two centuries in various international agreements.
Great Britain placed mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer navigate in large parts of the ocean, which was even dangerous for neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations held an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison with him.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Even between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place over the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, fierce wars took place between various nobles who were fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period is recorded as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the idea that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, positions were available to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and suitable candidates to succeed.
The same applies to the army. Military ranks are no longer based on a person's class, but on their caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolt.
Mohammed deeply occupied himself with otherworldly matters. He often went to a cave, later known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noor, for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has withstood the test of time, provides a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of the mountaintops on the north side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it wasn't easy to find at all. Once inside the cave, complete isolation prevails.
The only things visible are the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of the numerous large pyramid structures erected in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or 'Pyramids of Giza', in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid, which is the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built as a tribute to Khufu’s wives and family members.
The up-bow mark looks like a V, and the down-bow mark looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Above means you should start at the tip and push the bow away from you. Below means you should start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An upward movement usually produces a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your personal markings, but don't forget that the printed markings are there for musical reasons and should therefore usually be respected.
A group of market women were behind the departure of the terrified Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and their two young children (Marie Therese, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They travelled back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and menacing crowds that threatened the Royal Couple.
Due to the actions of the crowd, the king and queen were forced to open all the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism with regard to the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people.
They were required by the American colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large portion of the costs, and the interest on bonds was disbursed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested largely on the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the order’s creation.
The period in which this occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, encompassing European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Following the Early Middle Ages came the High Middle Ages. These were in turn followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share these two common beliefs: that the development of technology follows a trajectory largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has ‘effects’ on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
Some will argue, for example, that the advent of the car automatically leads to road construction.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater number of accidents on the road, which in turn drives the development of new techniques in healthcare to rehabilitate the human body.
In the Romantic era, a significant element of cultural determinism was embraced, stemming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography. These formed a harmonious society and were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known from approximately 400 AD to approximately 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The prestige of the Byzantine Empire declined in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic architecture flourished in the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a distinct style began to develop in Western Europe. One of the biggest developments was a result of the Crusades: people began using buttons to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is farming where enough food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Farming for subsistence is a simple system that is usually organic. It uses saved seed originating from the ecoregion, and combines this with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture. This is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can distinguish themselves through the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of one or more of these factors.
Members of a subculture often display their group affiliation through a distinct symbolic style in what they wear, how they behave, and the jargon they speak.
One of the most frequently used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was pointing to the few regrettable cases of children who, due to neglect, adversity, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children were locked away by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents could not accept the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Unmanageable children may have experienced severe child abuse or a serious trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, and others are reported to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child, not raised by humans, can exhibit behaviors resembling those of the animal that cared for it (within physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards people.
Learning based on projects should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but a tool to support individuals dealing with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. A teacher, for example, is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip assistant.
There is a form of virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids, and explains procedures that students might find difficult to understand without assistance.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where no one cares about them, and where they cannot develop – yet this happens.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
The intention of foster care is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the internet, elements of interpersonal and mass communication are combined.
The diverse characteristics of the internet lead to new dimensions regarding the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
'Learning' and 'socialization' are, for example, presented as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal relevance' and 'ongoing relationships' when they researched public responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
It is specifically argued that no one can recognize a lie by relying solely on micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay "The President's Speech" how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can nevertheless accurately gauge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
Mutation adds new genetic variation; selection eliminates this variation from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, variation occurs between the two groups through segregation and recombination.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can hardly obtain the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found on the savanna.
Furthermore, failing to do so can have serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately even death.
The easiest plant-based sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means waking up for a reason during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep within a short time (10–60 minutes).
This is fairly easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without immediately waking you up fully.
If you turn off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room. This way, you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on your biorhythm include, for example, drinking plenty of fluids before bed (specifically water or tea, a known diuretic). This will likely mean you’ll need to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses is in contrast to the amount of stress someone carries in their body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Everyone is capable of achieving contentment and complete peace.
Everyone can enlighten their mind. Only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its foundation in the teachings of the Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation, and the practice of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualized imagery, the energy of Kundalini yoga (energy of enlightenment) is awakened.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as the focus. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a collaboration between the USSR and the US came about. When the war ended, conflicts between system, process, and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies stood opposite each other two years after the end of the war, this marked the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, and battles with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until September 17, 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were overtaken by events overnight when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded, forming the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland. This was in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international peace treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Goods transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy’s task has been to ensure a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while hindering the enemy’s ability to do the same.
The US attempted to get personnel and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to the British, and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII, it is one of the most remarkable recent examples of this.
The German navy attempted to simultaneously halt this traffic, primarily using U-boats.
Just like the rest of Europe, Great Britain would likely have fallen into German hands had the Allies failed.
It appears that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
In antiquity, cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could always easily obtain hair, meat, milk, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goatherds, just as the more well-known shepherd often employs a child or younger person. Herding still takes place in the same way today.
As early as the 16th century, horse-drawn railways were built in England.
Although horse-drawn railways consisted of nothing more than a track of planks, the horses still had to walk faster and pull larger loads than they did on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Crossbars were used relatively early on to keep the rails in place. However, people gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron point on top.
This quickly became standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden coach wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden versions. In 1767, the first completely iron rail was laid.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People began walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (that means upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, walked upright less often.
Fossil evidence of Australopithecus, dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, shows adaptations for bipedalism. Furthermore, Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more sustainably, join an environmental movement, or even take action to mitigate future suffering, even if only slightly.
In many cases, it’s just like treating the symptoms. But if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the root cause of the problems and eliminate it.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly and profoundly changed the Earth. Moreover, overpopulation and extravagant human lifestyles have exacerbated these problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap a few streets away. This draft was signed by the President of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon first publicly read the document on July 8th in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists believe that a type of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind you of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their feet, they lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that precise poison.
This group of insects is formally called "true bugs" by entomologists.
This term originates from an age-old agreement with bed bugs, which are insects that are very good at parasitizing humans.
Both red roof bugs and bed bugs are nest-bound, having adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the US, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological condition affecting adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest, or that of their child.
These couples can choose to give their baby up for adoption.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the most important goal of science. This method serves as a guideline for most scientific research.
Yet it’s about more than just explorations; an exploration is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, raise questions, and make observations, serving as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle’s views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West increasingly failed to understand Greek philosophy and science as knowledge of the Greek language declined.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not simply reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a specific period of time, even without external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted. In one experiment, the DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein of the phage was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are heritable. Other mutations can cause cells to die or can lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who enjoy visiting natural areas because they want to appreciate the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
On site, one can, among other things, hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, visit parks, and study the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages to their workplaces, passing people whose workplaces are located in the village they just left.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that due to this enormous carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely encountered.
Why is it that so many complaints arise with transport systems, why does it go wrong daily? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
When analyzing traffic flow, attention is paid to the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably. This means that traffic flows exhibit some degree of consistency, and that this can be described mathematically.
Connections have been made between the three core properties to better represent traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Using those relationships, the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to evolve flight. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places from predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
About a few thousand years ago, Aristarchus stated that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were some people who thought he was right, but many people believed quite the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, and therefore the Sun (and other stars) as well.
This sounds fairly logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world’s largest and second-longest river, and carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth and is six miles wide in some places.
At least 20% of all the water that flows into the sea via rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already more than a thousand years old at that time.
Approximately 800 people live in Vatican City. This is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the official language for the official communication and laws of Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since antiquity, because they are all found in nature and it is relatively easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This seemed more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we observe.
Alloys are, simply put, a combination of at least two metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals category. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms could fit on the tip at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has diminished in status as newer writing methods have emerged and is now used far less frequently.
Nowadays, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You could wonder what will happen to the keyboard once something new comes onto the market.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
As if you're pushing a heavy cart uphill. If the nucleus is split again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, meaning they fall apart with the slightest disturbance.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outermost layer of the moon.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more craters on the side, as the crust is thinner there. Lava could more easily reach the surface there.
Content theories aim to uncover what motivates people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people desire certain things and which environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory.
Generally, two approaches emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. In one approach, they try to position themselves as equals.
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary action, conduct performance reviews, delegate tasks, and hold people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, this person transforms into someone unrecognizable. They feel the need to change everything the team has done so far, and want to take ownership of everything.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, although there are slight differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to embark on the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity emerge when all available resources within an organization's functional departments are used effectively.
The result of this is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
To enable innovation within an organization, management must foster a culture that prioritizes innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition. This allows the research area to be narrowed down and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
Because of the increasing number of new technologies, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models with which we can gain more insight into the processes of our minds.
AI immediately makes most people think of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior falls under AI research.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-world problems.
Nowadays, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often, a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip isn't an option.
Thanks to technological advancements, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students to view artifacts in a museum, peek inside an aquarium, or see beautiful works of art—all from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a fantastic way to reminisce about a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned annually and whose previous versions are preserved online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students become better writers. Their grammar and spelling are often poor at first, but this quickly changes because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve their writing and thus avoid criticism.
Through blogging, students are also compelled to learn more about the world around them. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
With proper use, blogs can help students develop analytical skills and critical thinking; by actively engaging in discussion online, students can find their own place in relation to the material of others and simultaneously determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and future.
Further south you'll find Niagara Falls. In the north, you'll find the beautiful, unspoiled Muskoka and more.
Things like this are what make Ontario seem typically Canadian to outsiders.
Further north, large areas are sparsely populated, and part of these areas is almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is almost a continent of its own.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent countries or are associated with France, and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought with them the Islamic faith, which then spread widely on Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west, and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: female travelers are advised to say they are married, whether or not that is true.
It also helps to wear rings (not ones that look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour they may find intimidating, and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when rejecting a man, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't handle this well!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic harbor by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the harbor and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they abandoned the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish traders who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you’ll find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and other trinkets, but it’s very much geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was devastated when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, spewing lava and burying most of the city's streets, particularly the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, you should check the situation regarding the fighting ongoing in the North Kivu province before visiting areas outside of Goma.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and is home to some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
You can get around Goma by boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Timbuktu is relatively inaccessible and is therefore now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a dilapidated city, although the city’s reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the key stops on the PBS exhibition *Special Wonders of the African World* by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country because it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique in the east, the border with Zimbabwe in the north, and with the Crocodile River marking its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, home to a variety of wild animal species.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entrance charges apply.
It can also be useful to purchase a Wild Card. These offer either access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and that is considered the most important place by many tourists.
The large number of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph, visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the harbor.
The vast majority of Hong Kong’s population lives very close together on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into India and Bangladesh.
The Sundarbans have now been officially added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The portion within Indian borders is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps – they also contain some of the last mighty remnants of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is peatland and marshland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and the area is now estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, primarily heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang.
It's wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, as the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses operate that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis allow you to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guianan city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and features two passageways, each 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the vertical clearance is 15 meters. Construction of the bridge was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
According to schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. The Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use at that time.
The Guarani were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters, and also practiced subsistence farming.
In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly also known as 'the great province of the Indies', emerged in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the indigenous population.
A three-century period of colonization under the Spanish followed.
Asunción was founded in 1537, and since then Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year will take place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Here, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen at other times of the year.
Check the Argentine Polo Association for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). Its value is approximately one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, there is only one bank, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West shop. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands, you probably can’t pay with a credit card, but likely can with British and American currency. Ask the owners in advance about the ways you can pay.
Exchange your money back before you leave the islands, as Falkland Islands currency is very difficult to exchange elsewhere.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. Temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains approximately consistent throughout the year, without discernible 'wet' and 'dry' seasons.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are still wild at the end of the day. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters distance from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Moose, bison, reindeer, bears, and pretty much any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking fragrant foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Around 1850, Apia was founded and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor, an event that later became known as the infamous standoff.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed at a peaceful gathering that escalated into violence in the city.
There are many beaches, particularly due to Auckland’s two harbours. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
Along Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches can get crowded sometimes and offer a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that isn't a complex beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is also readily available if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries resulting from these trips are rare.
Despite this, seek expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are present near beaches and river mouths north of Town of 1770 from October to April. They sometimes appear outside of these months as well.
Sharks do indeed occur, but they rarely attack people. The majority of sharks are afraid of humans and would actually swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with specific hotels, but you can usually also book other types of accommodation, such as a campsite pitch, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even packages with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you’d like a little more time to consider the offer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, if you have a request or wish to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to be early to secure a camping spot near the music.
And keep the following in mind: even when the music has stopped on the main stages, music may still be played on other parts of the festival grounds late into the night.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is located if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the passage through the ice makes an enormous noise if you are too close.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically strive to maximize the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and the exit can sometimes be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep them in good spirits and prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer complimentary alcoholic beverages. However, when people are drunk, it impairs their judgement, and all seasoned gamblers know that staying sober is hugely important.
If you go high into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you need to be aware that there may be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction, and therefore it drives differently than on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short period to get stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not impede traffic there.
The biggest tourist attraction in Africa are safaris, which are the highlight of many visitors’ trips.
The term "safari" commonly refers to overland journeys to view the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs, and leopards, you'll need binoculars. Otherwise, the chances of seeing them are small.
A walking safari (also known as a 'forest walk' or 'loop safari') involves walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics were held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events were played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
As expected, most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000. Regular tickets are expected to cost around ¥7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available. You can often borrow these items, even if they aren’t in the room.
If an iron isn't available or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer, if available.
Make sure the fabric doesn't get too hot (this can cause it to shrink, or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in various ways. Some methods are effective at addressing specific risks.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others, water needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not found in their home country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that injure or kill people with force, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the ability to purchase goods exempt from tax and excise duties at certain locations.
Travellers going to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh; you often drive through desolate, back country, which makes this route a major challenge.
Aren’t you used to driving on country roads? Then pay attention. You’ll encounter many steep hills, narrow streets, and sharp bends.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent areas – usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h – and it’s even more important to adhere to them here than elsewhere.
Surprisingly, you have much better coverage here than in other remote parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great, and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of its southern neighbour, Austria.
You see a lot of fruit pastries here. The pastries contain apples year-round, and cherries and plums in the summer months.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and taste great with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want a few small but powerful pastries, try some called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen in the region.
To make a curry, you need spicy and flavorful ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be 'dry' or 'wet'.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries, while in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, chilies, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant herbs.
Stirrups support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also pose safety problems because a rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but remains caught in the stirrup with their foot, they can be dragged along by the horse. To reduce this risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders primarily wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, and English saddles in particular, are equipped with safety stirrup bars. These allow a stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backwards when a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination. It is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces, which seem to have endless potential.
Downhill winter sports like skiing and snowboarding are very popular. You glide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes called 'ski bums', and who plan entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
Skiing has existed for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backcountry skiing: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It’s not quite the same, but it’s similar to alpine skiing or mountaineering, which are often done on steep terrain. Here you need much sturdier skis and boots.
You can consider the ski route as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover greater distances by skiing than by walking, but it rarely happens that you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for visas and undergo passport controls multiple times.
However, in this area, the Schengen Area functions almost as one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can usually cross the border without undergoing another passport check.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen country, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which produced articles are considered antique. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition can vary by location. For example, the age limit is lower in North America than in Europe.
It is possible to consider artisanal products as antiques, even if they are newer than comparable mass-produced items.
Among the Sámi, herding reindeer is an important form of livelihood. Also, the culture surrounding trade is very important to many with other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding. They made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Many Sámi people work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is a major source of income.
The word 'zigeuner' is primarily used by non-Roma people. However, it is also often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma.
If there is travel advice in effect for the country you wish to travel to, this may have consequences for your health insurance during the trip or your cancellation insurance.
You can consult the advice of other governments in addition to the advice of your own government. However, their advice is geared towards their own residents.
Thus, American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice includes only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often give a fleeting, general, and extremely simplistic picture in comparison to other, more detailed sources.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are various types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Phenomena and consequences of severe weather include strong winds, hail, large amounts of precipitation and wildfires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms are, among others, examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks associated with severe weather conditions in their surroundings, as these may also affect some travel plans.
Everyone who wishes to visit a country considered a war zone should receive professional training.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' online will likely return the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues outlined here are normally discussed in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, a lot of first aid, and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about surviving in the wilderness. However, there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned gender-affirming surgery abroad should ensure they have the correct documentation for their return journey.
It varies considerably whether governments are willing to issue passports that do not state a gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Searches during security checks have also become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can expect not to pass through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow onto the beach.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid current towards deep water can develop.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion as they try to swim against the current. This may simply be impossible.
Once you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is a piece of cake.
Try to focus on a spot where you won't be grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than culture shock (you have less of a 'honeymoon feeling'), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their own.
If you have lived abroad and then return, you will have adapted to the new culture and, in doing so, will have lost some habits from your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding. They realized that travelers needed to adjust to a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with lights and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in complete silence before the show begins.
Often, the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of the lights and sounds is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as a projection on the pyramids, and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have been claimed by various countries ever since. They have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano serving as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth lies on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula transition into a plateau, after which they reappear to form the 360 km long Mount Ellsworth mountain range, which is traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson, at 4892 meters, is the highest mountain.
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no mobile phone reception.
A satellite phone isn't really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is frequently used by the shipping industry, including recreational boats, and for expeditions requiring external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information about how to connect to this service.
It is becoming increasingly popular for people planning a gap year to travel and learn.
Especially recent graduates use this to take a gap year before university without negative consequences for their studies.
Often, enrolling in an education program abroad during a gap year can increase your chances of continuing higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees must be paid to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for boating. The 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
Hunting is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos along the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people enjoy boating in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The number is the same as that of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, the number is, for example, one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
You can spend several full days in the historic town and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed of it: it's no different than many fears that other people have too.
If you understand how airplanes work, this can help to alleviate a fear stemming from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the aircraft.
Courier companies receive generous compensation to deliver items quickly. For business documents, goods, or spare parts for an essential repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could deploy their own aircraft for certain routes, but it became more difficult for other routes and smaller companies.
If they ship things by air freight, it can take days on some routes for them to be unloaded and clear customs.
It could be processed faster only as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, a corresponding passenger must be present, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or even better, have your employer foot the bill).
However, this is not cheap: a general rule of thumb is that you pay about four times the economy class price for business class, and about eleven times for first class.
Generally, it's usually pointless to look for discounts on business or first-class tickets for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there’s a group of flyers willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the airlines charge accordingly.
Chisinau is the Moldovan capital. Romanian is primarily spoken here, but Russian is also widely used.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was burdened by an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova. This republic has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port after Istanbul, and a good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, İzmir is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center on a bay, surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers topped with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, ancient mosques and churches – yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditionally Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a unique eight-sided church.
On a number of graves near the church stand fascinating marble dove sculptures.
If you have half an hour to spare, you should definitely take a look around this little village.
In the north, you will find the easily accessible, romantic, and fascinating town of Sintra. Sintra became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron spoke highly of its beautiful monuments there.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stopover in Cabo da Roca.
Also go north and visit the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally renowned Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, but also a place that holds immeasurable significance for a large part of the world’s population.
Many men and women who survived their time here are still alive, and many of them have loved ones who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Show all due respect, solemnity, and dignity during your visit. Do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by placing markings or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the residents prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Yet most signs are in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the law.
Spanish is widely spoken on public transport and in other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English, and also Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, it doesn't hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave as someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-mannered). This will make exploring Paris much easier.
The tough exterior of Parisians quickly disappears when you show you’re familiar with their ways.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, and this forested area primarily consists of beech, spruce, and pine, encompassing a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There is a remarkably high diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soil types, and varying differences in altitude.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the black grouse can be found here, alongside all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt below the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually, women are given a wrap-around shawl when arriving unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own, in bright, garish colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a friendly smile.
On the other hand, men must wear trousers to at least below the knee.
You can also borrow those from the stock by the entrance, but this clothing isn’t washed after every use, so you might not be comfortable with that. One size fits all for men!
Just like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and whatever flavorings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, just like you mean it, always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
In this way, you make an important distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It likely makes reading easier as well. Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation generally poses few problems.
You should pay the most attention to the 'c' and the 'g'. Their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
You also need to pronounce the 'r' and 'rr' differently: *caro* means sweetheart, while *carro* means wagon.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will therefore already teach you a lot about Persian grammar and help you understand sentences.
It's quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it's easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and serve as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't as big a problem back then as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those of today.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms and has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that’s where the concept originated.
The first cherry blossom festivals in Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look their best in a natural environment, which means you should resist the urge to remove even “just one” species.
When collecting samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and practically everything is available there upon arrival.
But when you are in the 'high tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the air is clear, which happens less often).
There are also some buses going north towards Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Check carefully if the bus you take actually goes into Hebron and doesn't just drive to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
You could, for example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also provide popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
People who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have also adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition of staying up all night on Easter until you eventually see the sunrise.
Naturally, Christian theological explanations can be found for this tradition, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on Saturday evening of the Easter weekend, during which congregations often celebrate a feast at the stroke of midnight to honor the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, it was impossible for mammals to make the journey. This resulted in the giant tortoise becoming the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, various mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During the winter, the polar night occurs in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, meaning the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance you will be able to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark more or less day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. That means you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Suits are standard work attire and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is crucial. The focus is on team performance rather than praising individual achievements.
Employees often need to get approval from their supervisors before making a decision, and they are expected to follow their supervisors' instructions blindly.
