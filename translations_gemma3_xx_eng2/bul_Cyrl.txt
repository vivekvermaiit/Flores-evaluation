This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely popular, but also provides details that fossils generally don’t, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the upper side of this animal’s feathers was chestnut-brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also allows insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – branching and barbules – researchers conclude that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. According to the researchers, although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult specimen, not down feathers.
Researchers suggest that while this may be the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult, not the down of a juvenile.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team is looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon pulls on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way it affects ordinary matter.
This theory posits that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

From the infrared images, it is visible that the temperature fluctuations between night and day illustrate the possibility that these are caves.
They are cooler than the adjacent surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal state isn't as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground," said Glenn Cushing from the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Traditionally, voting in France is a low-tech process: voters isolate themselves in a booth, indicate their chosen candidate on a pre-printed paper ballot, and place it in an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, they cast their ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter list.
French election law defines the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting and that no other envelopes are placed inside except for those of duly counted and eligible voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four women from the seated skiing group did not finish their runs, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the competition.
The police in Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D.K. Aria stated that they had arrested the five individuals who raped the Swiss woman, and had returned her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanzhar, Buta Kanzhar, Rampuro Kanzhar, Gaza Kanzhar, and Vishnu Kanzhar are the names of the defendants.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police chief, stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed to allow emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeko has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court since then, charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody, awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness testimony could be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scots law operates differently and courts view the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that “it appears journalists are treading a dangerous line if they disseminate photos, etc., of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecution Service, responsible for criminal prosecution, told journalists that no further comments would be made until charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document will concern the border dispute, which Palestine seeks based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
It is assumed that other discussed topics are about the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both sides, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Following the signing of the agreement, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, while Pennsylvania agrees to implement such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test had to be closely supervised by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the hunting program of the Australian Shooting Sports Association, qualified volunteers were hired in partnership with NPWS and the Shooting Sports Association (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four shooters selected for the first cull received detailed safety briefings and training.
Martelly swore before the newly formed nine-member temporary election commission yesterday.
This is the fifth temporary election commission in Martell in four years.
Last month, a commission to the President recommended the resignation of the previous electoral commission (CEC) as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martel's response to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October, was the commission.
Violent protests were sometimes triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been expected since 2011.
Around 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod devices have been reported. Overheating has been reported, causing a total of six fires and resulting in minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 incidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company described as “not serious.”
The ministry responded, calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported that there was no damage to the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has detained tourists as hostages in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and there are at least six confirmed fatalities at this time.
Six hostages, including children and adults, as well as Filipino photographers, were released earlier.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began investigating premature births in his free time.
His research shows that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the fetal development of the baby's lungs.
Government investigators discovered two flight recorders, or "black boxes," on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Luna was paid tribute by fellow fighters as well.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, like her. She was a strong woman.”
“Luna is strange like me… maybe even more so… I love her and I will miss her… let’s hope she’s in a better place,” commented Dustin “Golddust” Runnels.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those opposing the idea of turning Australia into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of those surveyed, who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Ultimately, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while according to 31%, Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and compete in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is now in doubt due to his complaints.
He couldn’t take the medication he needed to manage the pain, as it was banned during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different software and hardware before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets were formed, especially how Earth formed, after comets collided with Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense."
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA states that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
She uses satellite-based technology, unlike the older ground-based radar technology, to allow flight controllers to provide pilots with more accurate information and determine the precise location of aircraft.
No additional transport will be provided, and trains will not stop at Wembley; there is no parking available on site, nor are there any park-and-ride facilities.
Fear of transport issues raised the possibility that the game might have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal *Science* reports the emergence of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that this process would take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), and the non-native cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any shape. It can be drawn into fine wires.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be braided and twisted, and then forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to another metal. So thin, in fact, that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books known as “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is the pH of a chemical substance. Using red cabbage juice, you can make an indicator.
Depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a chemical is, cabbage juice changes color.
The quantity of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the tested chemical indicates the pH level.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powdered substances and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, you’ll feel it a little strange, and something like a coating will form.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were discovered in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women gathered together in mixed company.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing we have thanks to the wheel is much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and many other vehicles.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
And finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) feeding on a far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their secret to success is the niche concept, a special job each cat holds, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Packs consist of one to three related adult males, together with up to thirty females and young.
Women are typically closely connected, a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides act very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and just as deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a well-rounded athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, make huge leaps, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones characterized by roaring.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t fully resemble the lion’s roar, but rather sounds like the utterance of growling, screaming words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all of the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, smelling where they have been on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and pouncing on their victims.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it crosses a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island, making return difficult), it will often find itself in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different functions or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population hasn’t changed at all; it still needs the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Ultimately, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will diverge so much that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants, and we also make clothes from them. Most edible foods are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the roof of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked everything, including anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex couldn’t compare to it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had quite a few strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate seated on chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together, reclining on their sides while eating.
It is not possible for ancient Roman dishes to have included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor potatoes, nor tomatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life takes place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; the shops consisted only of shelves facing the street. Houses were built of stone.
In the Land of Canaan there were no extensive forests, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Scandinavian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and traveling west, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite each of the countries being “Scandinavian,” there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.
You might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence if you’ve seen the movie “National Treasure.”
However, that is not true. This is not a treasure map, although there is something written on the back of the document.
The words “Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776” are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the document upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that initially, after its creation, the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Most likely, the notation was added simply as a label.
With the D-Day landings and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy. These were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
The Allies landed in Southern France on August 15, 1944, and the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, American and French forces liberated Southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization represents a culture shared by a significant and large group of people working and living together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civic," related to the Latin "civis" or "citizen" and "civitas," which in turn is "city" or "city-state," and this somehow defines the size of society as well.
City-states were the predecessors of nations. Culture, in the context of civilization, implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and natural dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence of their existence, and therefore fail to be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, with Congress being its only component according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national judicial or executive authority, it relied on state governments – which often refused to cooperate – to enforce all of its acts.
It also has no authority to reject tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The clauses required unanimous consent from all states to be amended, and the states treated the central government so unseriously that their representatives were often absent.
Alongside the German national football team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world. They were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, volleyball, basketball, cycling, water polo, fencing, rugby, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in both international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan possesses nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, as a geographical concept, it is often referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan traces its origins back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing changes to local grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to labor on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the loss of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main structures, namely the Temple of the Sun, Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the perimeter of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most common format for still photography in the world, for example, is 35mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number denominator) is therefore 3:2.
Formats with equal or very close ratios are very common (for example, the group of APS formats).
The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is simply a guideline creating dynamics while simultaneously maintaining a measure of order in the image.
It states that the most suitable place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally (See the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had already become wealthy and powerful, was subject to criticism.
Christianity has connected European countries for over a thousand years, despite linguistic differences and various customs.
His sweeping power affected everyone – from the king to the common man.
A core Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s financial resources exist for precisely that reason.
The central governance of the church continued in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was upheld.
Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
Despite the fact that this blockade violated customary international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, the strategy proved effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies.
The United Kingdom is laying mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean, creating danger even for neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic is limited, Germany expects a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, an attitude of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
People wanted to avoid a military situation again in the future, after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I.
To accept a job at the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a collection of poetry, and a letter of introduction to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former employer/manager).
In Ancient China, there was a unique way of denoting different periods of time; a separate dynasty represented each stage of history or each ruling family.
Between each two dynasties there was also a period of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Ancient China. Fighting to take the highest seat in the magnificent Xian palace, thousands perished.
There were many social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
Additionally, after the Revolution, enrollment was opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army units being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. To meditate, he often visited a cave, which became known as “Hira” on Mount Nur (light).
The cave itself, surviving through time, conveys a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it’s not easy to find at all, even knowing that it exists. Once you enter the cave, the isolation is complete.
Nothing else is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaoh.
In the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, on the Giza Plateau, or “Giza Necropolis”, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and family members.
The "up arrow" sign looks like a V, and the "down arrow" sign looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start from the top and press the bow, while down means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and then pull it.
An upward bow stroke usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow stroke is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to add your own markings, but remember that the printed bowings are there for musical reasons, and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of women from the market.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and screaming threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard, killed at Versailles, before the horrified queen.
The Filipinos themselves paid for the military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
The US colonial regime forced them to pay taxes to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
The super-profits obtained from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people naturally constitute key gains of American imperialism.
To understand the meaning of the Templars, the context that led to the order’s creation must be clear.
The period during which these events took place is usually called the Late Middle Ages – a period in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice – from technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is governed by a logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Two common ideas are shared between most interpretations of technological determinism: either the development of technology itself follows a path far exceeding cultural or political influence, or technology influences societies in inherent, rather than socially conditioned, ways.
For example, one might say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also led to a higher frequency of road accidents, necessitating the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the recovery of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a strong element of cultural determinism, which was initiated by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arise; these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as a center of luxury dates back to around 400 BC and continued until approximately 1100 BC.
Her status declined in the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as spices and silk, which were more valued than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of "Fashion Capital" shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes, which is one of the biggest developments of that time.
Subsistence farming is farming conducted to produce enough food solely for the needs of the farmer and their family.
Market gardening is a simple, often organic system, frequently utilizing saved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with crop rotation and other relatively straightforward techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel neglected by societal standards. They allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as independent can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical in nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most frequently used means of illustrating the importance of socialization is the example of several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, mistreatment, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their formative years.
These children are called “untamed” or feral. Some untamed children have been kept confined by people (usually their own parents); sometimes the abandonment of such children was due to parents rejecting a child’s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children, before being abandoned or running away, may have been severely abused or traumatized.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by animals, a feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) almost entirely mimicking that of the specific animal caregiver, as well as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning aims to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather support provided to individuals going through new learning, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a type of scaffold, as is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
The software includes built-in virtual assistants designed to ask questions, provide prompts, and explain procedures that students might find too difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many and varied reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that isn't encouraging, nurturing, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
It is expected that our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, as well as reliable healthcare.
Foster care is intended to provide everything that was lacking in the home from which the children were removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and individual communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding the application of the satisfaction approach.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “long-term relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Imey and McCord (1998) when they researched audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last several milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his work "The President’s Speech," Oliver Sacks points out how, despite being unable to understand speech due to brain damage, people are still able to perceive genuine emotion.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for amino acids through the available plant resources.
Moreover, the consequences of failure are serious: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins from the leaves and seeds of legumes, but they are difficult for us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-sourced foods (termites, ants, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual bedtime and falling back asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The less stress there is, the more positive the life force becomes. Everyone has the potential to discover absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. Our own tension and negativity are the only things standing in the way of reaching this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended by many techniques from Indian yoga and the Mahayana path of love.
Tibetan Buddhism is built on a very simple principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy for enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, visualizations, and mantras.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightenment of consciousness is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, differences in system, process, and culture led to conflict between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had already become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It continued for the next 40 years and was a real battle waged through mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Cuba, Afghanistan, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
These plans, however, became invalid almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after seizing the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to carry a huge number of people and cargo across the oceans.
The traditional mission of navies is to ensure your country’s ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to do the same.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy is trying to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have conquered Great Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were typically raised in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often accompanied by goatherds who were usually children or young men, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These herding methods are still used today.
Railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railway tracks consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the more uneven roads typical of the time.
Cross-ties were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective with an iron strap on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Gradually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of locomotion was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been discovered in fossils of australopithecines dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs even earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living with more care for the environment, join an environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce negative impacts to some extent in the future.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is evident that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancement of humanity, and problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and people’s extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, the handwritten copy was sent to the printing shop of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as “Dunlap broadsides”.
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 single-sided Dunlop copies on large sheets, of which it is still known that they exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But for the birds that still resemble dinosaurs, there are many things.
They have feet with claws and scales, walk on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and lay eggs.
Almost all computers used today operate on the basis of manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these digits are called binary digits – or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't always manifest immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The presence of an open container with medicine or toxic household chemicals can be the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "bubolechka" is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from the long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Just like flying bed bugs, common bed bugs are colorless and live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Upon adoption, the parental rights of the biological parents are terminated, after which the other couple can become the child’s parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
It’s not just experimentation, although experiments are also used to eliminate some possible hypotheses; asking questions and using guides also accompany scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers work more with classical texts, and specifically with the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were adopted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek scientific and philosophical roots.
In physiology and behavior, many of the observed rhythms often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are more than just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run the cycle of free-running even without external signals.
One of the leading pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells, mutations can have a wide range of effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is appealing to people with an interest in visiting natural areas in order to admire the landscape, including wild plant and animal species.
The activities that can be done here include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks, as well as learning about information regarding the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo are examples of this.
Every morning, to get to their workplaces, people commute from small provincial towns by car, and pass others whose work destination is the place the first ones have just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is to some extent connected to and supports the transport system through private cars.
That this massive carbon-based economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years, is now shown by science.
Every person is a part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely so many complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they break down daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Since the behavior of drivers, unfortunately, cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty, studying traffic flow is difficult.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows have some logical consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections assist in the planning, design, and ultimately the operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly has helped them avoid their enemies more easily and find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings today.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many hold the opposite view – that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching 6 miles wide in places.
The Amazon delivers a full 20 percent of the water that rivers on the planet pour into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their predecessors, which monuments were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the country with the smallest population and the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and for official communication.
While Latin is often used in religious ceremonies, Italian is the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of them can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements – earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There also exist alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
The universe is made of matter, and matter is, in turn, made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, when it appeared, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens and don't have to touch pencil sharpeners.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
A nuclear-plutonium bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, nuclear fission releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which is why they are prone to decay with a small nudge or without any nudge at all.
The lunar surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
She is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust there is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of happiness focus on discovering what resonates with people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that, upon reaching maturity, have been internalized.
These theories explore what drives certain people to want the things they do, and which elements of their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory of Motivation" are two popular content theories.
Generally speaking, once managers start leading their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On one side are those who try to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This type of managers struggle with implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
A person transforms, at the other end of the spectrum, into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often leads to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact with their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the leadership team to which each member reports. This team sets the standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? Putting innovation into practice is one of the goals for applying concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result of this, the organization's working process to overcome an obstacle may lead to a new, innovative process serving the needs of the client.
Before an organization can become innovative, its leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as organizational learning and shared knowledge.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher results.
Physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is provided by neurobiological data. This narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The connection between pathology and brain behavior supports scientists' research.
It is well known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes in our consciousness.
Although artificial intelligence has great significance in science fiction, it forms a very important branch in computer science, dealing with learning, behavior, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automatically perform tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Some examples that can be cited are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Similar problems have evolved into separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life issues.
The artificial intelligence system embedded in several home computer and software applications for video games is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a large part of school education. Very often, the teacher would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a field trip report is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina create a webpage for their trip to the state capital; each year this page is redesigned, but older versions are preserved online to serve as a sketchbook.
Blogs can aid in improving students’ writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience typically changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger has begun to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to be more aware of the world around them." The need to cultivate audience interest inspires students to be engaging and intelligent (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the regular school day.
Through the appropriate use of blogs, “students can be enabled to become more analytical and more critical; by actively responding to online materials in the context of others’ writings, students can define their positions and also outline their own viewpoints on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming and bilingual capital of Canada, where there are numerous art galleries and museums where you can see the past and present of Canada.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north lie the pristine natural beauties of Muskoka and the surrounding lands.
All of these things solidify Ontario as a model for typically Canadian, according to foreigners.
The large areas in the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited deserts.
A comparison of populations that surprised many: the number of African Americans in the US is larger than the number of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean, close to the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and, in terms of wildlife, is a continent unto itself.
Most small islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a great influence in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India, rounding the Cape of Good Hope.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the west and south with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is advisable for every traveling woman to state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It’s nice to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can give rise to situations they perceive as harassment, where they are often followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm when refusing men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name "Casa Branca," but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city as Dar el-Beida, and the name Casablanca it received from Spanish merchants who established their trading bases there.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
It’s easy to find places around the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but all of this is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, particularly the center.
While Goma is relatively safe, all travel outside of Goma must be vetted to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, along with some of the most affordable ways to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use “boda-boda” (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Timbuktu," combined with its relative inaccessibility, has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite being turned into a tourist attraction due to its reputation and having an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS show “Wonderful World of the African Diaspora.”
The city sharply differs from the other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabic appearance than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and extends eastward along the border with Mozambique, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park stretches across 19,500 km², divided into 14 separate eco-zones, each with distinct wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
Typically, all South African national parks require daily entrance and park conservation fees.
It might also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either select parks in South Africa, or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is a place many tourists consider worth visiting.
The row of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong resembles a glittering column chart, standing out against the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To best explore Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon side across the harbor.
Most of the developed part of Hong Kong Island is densely situated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonizers seized, and if you’re looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, it’s a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps—they include some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², with almost one-third of this territory covered by water and wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart throughout the day from the intercity bus station (behind the river), although most of them, especially those traveling east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
It is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most neighborhoods are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel short distances, such as to Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two masts rise to 83 meters, the length is 378 meters, with 2 sails each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
According to plan, the bridge is scheduled to be put into operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous tribe whose members inhabited present-day Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, also practicing agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region is home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Paiagua, who survived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indians," was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its unique character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and individual players in the world.
The largest annual tournament is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched here at another time of the year.
Check Asociacion Argentina de Polo for news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at a bank located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop, which is the only one on the islands.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and American dollars are also often accepted within Stanley credit cards.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency may be used; speak to the hosts in advance to find out which method of payment is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above +30°C are normal during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity create a feel of being colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals remain wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven’t kept a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so do not invade their personal space.
Additionally, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 people.
Apia, which has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959, was founded in the 1750s.
A scandalous maritime standoff unfolded at the port in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the murder of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Oakland spans two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are guarded sandy beaches for swimming, and most have shade under the trees nearby.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are near the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the upscale Mission Bay and St Heliers areas in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is “Number One.” It’s not a heavy beer, but rather pleasant and refreshing. “Manta” is the name of the other local beer.
There are many French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might pair better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you're concerned.
The concept of a “flat white” coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is an “espresso”, cappuccino is piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. The fruit juices are a little pricey, but wonderful.
Many trips to the reef are year-round, and accidents on the reef caused by any of these reasons are rare.
Nevertheless, pay attention to the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of 1770. They can sometimes be encountered outside of this period as well.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance provides peace of mind for the traveler, knowing they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can also find other accommodation options, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages including breakfast, airport transfer, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be directed to the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a vast majority of attendees choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the event, you’ll need to go earlier to get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may have finished, there might be festival stages where music will continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the crossing over the ice causes quite a terrifying noise for those most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg also include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into keeping guests spending as much time and money as possible. As a rule, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
To keep guests in a good mood and encourage them to stay on the premises, they usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment deals.
In some places, free alcoholic beverages are offered. However, intoxication affects judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who will be driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blizzard conditions, as well as by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icing and snowfall are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic flows almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris likely represent the greatest tourist interest in Africa and are a final destination for many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular usage refers to a land journey to observe the stunning African wildlife, specifically in the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and you get a good view with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy and are best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bushwalk", "tourism safari", or "hiking safari") is a walk lasting several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between August 24th and September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, following its hosting of the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the season postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not being extended to July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Expectations are that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if there aren't any in the room.
If you don't have an iron or don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one.
Do not allow the fabric to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burns).
Water can be purified in various ways, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others several minutes are required.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider purchasing bottled water in a sealed container from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals themselves, which can harm or kill people through force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods without taxes and excise duties in designated areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The distance between Point Marion and Fairmont represents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through remote, sparsely populated areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous or subsequent sections, where they are typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h), and strict adherence to them is more important than elsewhere.
Interestingly, however, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are exceptionally good, while Bavarian ones are quite lavish and diverse, similarly to those prepared in their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used in baked goods year-round, while cherries and plums are enjoyed during the summer.
Many German baked goods include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes especially pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small, albeit rich pastries, try those which, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Kърито is a dish of meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the amount of liquid, the curry can be “dry” or “wet”.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be discovered throughout the country.
But if used without further specification, the term usually refers to dishes originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays widespread throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes numerous simply seasoned dishes, and the predominant flavors Javanese people prefer are chili peppers, peanuts, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), as well as a variety of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but safety concerns can arise due to the possibility of the rider's legs getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they will be dragged if the horse bolts. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Afterward, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety stirrups that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.
Kochamo Valley – the best destination for climbers in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with an abundance of large granite walls and chimneys.
The trails include breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amidst the endless potential of the walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities involving descending a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, more commonly known as the “ski boom,” who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians founded the first ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering, or ski hiking.
They are similar, but typically don’t involve ski touring in an alpine style or mountaineering, as the latter takes place on steeper terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you walk – but you will rarely achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean repeatedly reviewing visa applications and undergoing passport control.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
While within this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen member states, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as items over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even though they are not as old as mass-produced antique items.
Raising reindeer is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding this livelihood is important to many with other trades as well.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather made a living through fishing, hunting and similar activities, with reindeer primarily used as draft animals.
Today, many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is a profitable industry in Sápmi, one of the regions where the Sami live.
Despite being widely used, especially among non-Romanians, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate representations of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is included in travel advice bulletins, this may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may want to consult with other governments as well, but the advice of those governments is intended for their citizens.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Meetings are nothing more than a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The expressed opinions are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social problems, or loss of human life.
Everywhere in the world, there can be severe weather, and its manifestations are very diverse and can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather conditions include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers need to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area, as these can impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that can be designated a war zone should receive professional training.
The address of a local company will likely be provided when searching online for "hostile environment awareness training."
The course usually covers all the issues discussed here, but in much more detail and typically in conjunction with practice.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many first aid activities, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications examining military zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid return travel documents.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports to individuals with an unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to reflect a person’s desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to adhere to these documents is also a variable factor.
Searches at checkpoints have also become much more thorough in the period following September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals facing surgery should not expect to pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity fully intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the shore, often near a reef or something similar.
The return flow, due to the underwater topography, is concentrated in several deeper sections, and a rapid current towards the deep water can form there.
Most fatalities are due to exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is likely impossible.
As soon as you are out of the current, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for somewhere you won't be caught again, or you might want to wait for rescue – depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted.
The shock of returning home sets in faster than culture shock (with a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it relatively easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, and having adapted to the new culture there, you've lost some of your habits from the culture back home.
Initially, when you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that those arriving in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that returning travelers also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence, before the show begins.
You usually always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The history of light and sound is like a fairytale book.
The Sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
Several nations claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and they have the most bases, with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest island.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which boasts a spectacular natural harbor due to the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula flow into the plateau, after which they rise again to form a 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, dissected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or the Sentinel Ridge, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson reaching 4892 m.
In remote locations with no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones generally don't replace mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as by expeditions that require remote data and voice data.
More information regarding connection to this service can be provided by your local telephone service provider.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, giving them a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad would improve your chances of being accepted into higher education in your home country.
Typically, there is a "training" fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for sailing. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands located in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats and kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The number is the same in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it’s quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the range is from 1 to 40).
Most reputable Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you will be able to visit the historical city for two whole days, returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you disembark on shore using excursions organized by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Berlin, Germany is featured in some cruise brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all, and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have experienced a traumatic event or haven’t flown before.
This isn't something we should be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and hatred towards other things that a very large number of people have.
For some people, understanding how aircraft work, as well as what happens during flight, can help overcome fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is critical for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller firms, this has been a problem.
If items have been shipped by air, unloading and customs clearance on some routes can take days.
The only way for it to get there faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline rules do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, which is your case.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or even better, to get your company to pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn’t even make sense to look for business or first class discounts on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a significantly higher price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the secession of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which, despite having its own government and currency, is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
With a population of around 3.7 million, Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Located around a vast bay and surrounded by mountains, the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and vibrant commercial center.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers alternate with traditional red roofs, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere in the city is closer to Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvik village has a panorama view of the nearby island of Eysturoy and features an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, above some graves, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
It’s worth taking half an hour to walk around the exciting village.
At a short distance to the north lies the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendor was recorded by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the beautiful Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar), a site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting a mass grave site, as well as a place that holds immeasurable significance for a large portion of the world’s population.
There are still many living men and women who survived here, and many others who had close relatives and loved ones killed or who died from the work there, both Jews and others.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
Do not deface the property by marking or scribbling graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is the first official language by law.
At the same time, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other places.
In the subway, regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the automated system announces unplanned disruptions in a wide range of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is still by observing good manners and behaving in a “bien élevé” (well-bred) manner. This will significantly ease your visit.
The Parisians’ rough exterior will quickly disappear if you show a little politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park features dense forests, predominantly of beech, spruce and fir, with a mixed alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes, there is an exceptionally wide variety of plant communities.
The region has also provided refuge to an exceptionally diverse range of animal and bird species.
There you can see rare fauna species, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie, along with many other common species.
During their visit to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts below the knee, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries provide headscarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially in bright colors, you’ll receive a smile from the monk or nun right at the entrance.
By the same logic, men should wear pants that cover their knees.
The clothes can be borrowed from what's available at the entrance, but they aren't washed after each user, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those skirts. One size fits all men!
Like in similar zones in the Mediterranean, Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is “pa amb oli”: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available product like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word “Sie” – “You” (formal), are always capitalized, even mid-sentence.
This is an important rule for distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
It is thought to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to understand whether a verb or adjective has been used in a substantivized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are "c" and "g", as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure you pronounce R and RR differently: caro means dear, while carro means chariot.
Persian is an easy language and has a relatively straightforward grammar.
Therefore, this grammar handbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand the phrases better.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough a language not to require separate study.
These observatories, prior to today’s modern ones, are generally outdated and are now used as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution, even at its peak, wasn’t as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built nowadays.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Observing the cherry blossoms, known as “hanami,” has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms are the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy within the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to pick even "just one."
During a visit to a well-maintained garden, you will be thrown out for picking "samples" without a word.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place. It’s very easy to get around, and moreover, you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But once you’ve entered the “deep tropics,” just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll need to cope with both the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less frequently, when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses heading north towards Hebron, where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are traditionally buried.
Check the bus you intend to take to make sure it goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis as a theme for a vacation.
For example, exploring castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also map routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition to spend Easter night awake outdoors to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it’s also possible that it represents a pre-Christian spring fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with the congregation frequently beginning lively celebrations at the stroke of midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or sailing.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the first herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
Following the arrival of people to the Galapagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, cows, horses, rats, cats, and dogs were introduced there.
If you visit the regions of the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the Sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark almost around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and, consequently, low pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Workplace harmony is extremely important, with an emphasis on collective effort rather than rewarding individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain approval from superiors for every decision they make and are expected to follow their instructions without question.
