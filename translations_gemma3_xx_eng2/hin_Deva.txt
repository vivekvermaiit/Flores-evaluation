This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already prevalent, but it provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal had brownish pores and the color beneath the carotenoids was brownish-grey.
This research also provides a complete understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
However, dinosaur feather shafts were not fully developed and are called rachises. But their feathers possessed other features like barbs and barbules. Researchers hypothesize that, like other dinosaur features, the rachis likely evolved later on.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were used for temperature regulation or display, not for flight. Researchers have suggested that, even if it is a young dinosaur’s tail, the sample exhibits adult Sahelosaurus characteristics, not those of a juvenile’s lower body.
Researchers suggest that, even if it is the tail of a small dinosaur, the sample appears to be from an adult’s feather rather than a juvenile’s.

Most of the work done was theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would likely be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon creates a pull on Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that the darkest matter surrounding the galaxy is located as a halo and is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, inserting a paper ballot pre-printed with the candidate of their choice into an envelope.
Once the official confirms the voter’s identity, the voter places the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
France's electoral law strictly codifies procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes should have been transparent so that voters and observers could see whether any envelopes were present in the ballot box before voting began and whether any votes other than valid votes were cast.
Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted under strict supervision, following specific procedures by volunteers.

The road where the accident occurred was closed for a time while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
They were later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of his son.
The indictment and lawsuit are pending, but any eyewitness could be influenced, as their image has been widely published.
This is more common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have viewed the publication of the photos as potentially damaging.
University of Dundee Professor Pamela Ferguson writes, “If photos etc. of suspects are published, journalists walk a dangerous path.”
The Crown Office, responsible for prosecuting cases, has indicated to journalists that no comment will be made until at least an indictment is served.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Allegedly, other topics included were the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Following the signing of an agreement, Israel demands maintaining the current military situation for the next ten years, while the PA agrees to extend the current military situation for only five years.
Just as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated, so too were the marksmen in the supplemental pest control test to be closely monitored by the rangers.
Talented volunteers were recruited under a talent hunting show in partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters’ Association of Australia (NSW).
According to NPWS’s Acting Director General of Parks and Heritage, Mick O’Flaherty, the first four shooters selected for the culling operation received comprehensive instructions regarding safety and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as part of a new interim election council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP’s resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was formed in response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, violent protests have sometimes erupted due to remaining in power while conducting elections.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunction due to iPod overheating have surfaced, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that 34 cases of overheating have surfaced with Apple products, which the company did not take seriously.
The ministry responded to the postponement of Apple's report, stating it was "regrettable."
An earthquake struck in Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that no reports of damage were received in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has also said that there are no signs of a tsunami.
In the capital of the Philippines, Manila, a former Filipino police officer has hijacked their bus and is holding Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired upon tourists with his M16 rifle.
So far, many hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were quickly released, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers were later replaced by an elderly woman, as she urgently needed to use the restroom. Mendoza had been shot.
Ligins began their career in the field of medicine, like their father.
She was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Ligins began researching premature births during her free time.
Their research showed that if hormones are introduced, it will accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Luna was also paid tribute by fellow wrestlers.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on a famous night of two moons. That night was as special as she was. She was an incredibly powerful woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as strange as I was… perhaps even stranger… I loved her and will miss her… hope she’s in a better place.”
Before the 2010 federal election, 1,400 people were polled, showing an 8 percent increase since 2008 in the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of them expressed a desire in the poll to share the opinion that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
According to the survey results, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to his complaints.
They were unable to take the necessary medications to alleviate their pain because those drugs were banned in sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Many people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets, with their organic components, could potentially be a source of water delivery to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets had already collided with Earth much earlier.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo began his term and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
They called the rumors “political nonsense and foolishness.”
They were predicted to win the presidential election in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system will enable aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, and also reduce carbon emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology, which helps air traffic controllers manage aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport will be provided and Overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking on the ground and park & ride facilities will not be available.
The fear of transportation issues has increased the likelihood that the sports team will be forced to play behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the discovery of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process would take considerable time due to breeding between a resident Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortis*, and an immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be bent into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be beaten or made into sheets.
It can be made quite thin and applied to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color based on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
pH level is determined based on the concentration of hydrogen (H) ions present in it.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron).
Combine both dry powders together, then squeeze into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture from your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and create a kind of coating.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of bathhouses, which were used by both men and women together in groups.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back down, at the same time.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To place satellites or telescopes in space, you need a large rocket that is more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world extraordinarily. Most importantly, the wheel has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation like these.
Under them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and gazelles.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a variety of small creatures such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Each cat has a specific task that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the largest social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A lion pride typically consists of one to three adult males, along with more than thirty females and cubs.
Having a large family of sisters and daughters, females are usually closely connected to one another.
A group of lions functions much like a pack of wolves or dogs, exhibiting behaviors surprisingly similar to lions (but other big cats as well), and being very deadly to their prey.
Like a fully developed athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
Like tigers, leopards, and jaguars, lions also belong to the same genus (Panthera). These are the only four big cats that can roar.
A tiger’s roar doesn’t sound like the sharp roar of a lion, but rather is deep, more like a scream.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals. If they can catch them, they will prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and eat animals by scent, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark of night, and move forward very stealthily. Ocelots hunt by roaming their surrounding area and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they came from—such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or migrate to a new island making it difficult to return—they often find themselves in a different environment.
This new place has different resources and competitors, therefore the new population will need to adopt different qualities or changes to become a stronger competitor compared to before.
There has been no change in the native population, they still desire the same adaptability as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to new environments, they too begin to overlook [things], just like other populations do.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is a good thing and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans use to breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it feared no one except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may also have been cannibalistic.
They used to attack anything that went into the water, even a massive dinosaur like a T-Rex wouldn't stand a chance.
While most of their dishes would be familiar to us, the Romans included their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent—a dormouse—called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on the floor, the rich preferred to have lavish feasts together and enjoyed themselves while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god’s home.
People offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests serve them by dedicating their time to ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctum that only the priests could enter.
Distinctive pyramid-shaped towers (pagodas), sometimes also known as ziggurats, were built as part of the temple complex.
The top of the tower was a special inner sanctum for the deity.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't as necessary.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent in the open air.
Women used to cook in the courtyard; storefronts with open counters were visible on the street. Stone was used in the construction of the house.
Due to the lack of large forests in the land of Canaan, wood was very expensive there.
Greenland was very sparsely settled. Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he discovered Greenland, which he named Greenland.
But without paying attention to their discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776. “The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.”
While it is unknown who wrote it, the collection of large, leather-paper documents (measuring 24½ inches by 29¾ inches) was assembled.
Therefore, it is being assumed that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France was still not liberated.
This “Vichy” was ruled by the French people. It was these French people who established peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting the invaders.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called “Operation Dragoon.”
In just two weeks, Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A culture that is shared among a large group of people is called civilization. Here, people live together in society, cooperating with each other and working together.
The word 'civilization' comes from the Latin 'civilis', meaning civil, which is related to 'civis', also Latin, meaning citizen, and 'civitas', meaning city or city-state, and in a way, it also defines the scale of society.
City-states are at the forefront of nations. A civilizational culture means the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures disappear without major historical evidence and therefore don't achieve the status of civilization.
Under the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, with Congress as its sole component.
The Congress did not have any authority to levy taxes, as there was no national executive or judiciary. They relied on state officials, who were often uncooperative in implementing all of their actions.
It also had no authority to override the tax laws and duties between its states.
Before revising the proposal, unanimous consent was required from all states, and the states did not take the central government seriously, with their representatives often not even attending the meetings.
In terms of success, the Italian national football team comes after Germany's national football team; they were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, alongside Italians competing in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu). This ranks Japan as the world's 7th largest island!
Because Japan consists of a group of islands, it is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago."
Taiwan was discovered by European sailors in the 15th century. They called this island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly occupied the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings along the complex have been reconstructed to better show tourists what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used photography format in the world is 35mm. It was quite popular towards the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is, in fact, a bit misleading, as it is 24mm high by 36mm wide.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio approximately equal to or around this value.
The third rule, characterized by much mistreatment and frequent ridicule, is a simple guideline that dynamically creates order in an image while measuring its sequence.
This explains that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image diagonally and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown prosperous and powerful, came under scrutiny.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity has held European countries together for thousands of years.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the core Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are specifically intended for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church in Rome has existed for over a thousand years, and the concentration of so much power and wealth in one place has led many to question whether this doctrine was actually being fulfilled.
Immediately after declaring hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective by cutting off critical military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated international law, as generally accepted by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering large areas of the sea, creating a danger even for ships standing at the shore.
Since this strategy received limited response, Germany also expected a similar response regarding its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were prevalent views among most citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nation desires to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with Edison's company in New York City.
With four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation addressed to Thomas Edison (written by his former employer), he arrived in America.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage or each family that was in power was a specific dynasty.
Furthermore, it was a period of instability due to the division of states in every dynasty. During this period, the 60-year-long conflict between the Han and Jin dynasties over the division of the Three Kingdoms is quite famous.
A fierce war took place during this period between many princes vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was an era of the bloodiest stains in ancient Chinese history, with thousands perishing while fighting for the highest seat in the magnificent palaces in Xi'an.
The use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, changes in nationalism, and the nation’s trust being in the people rather than a single ruler – these things have a very significant social and political impact.
And, after the revolution, business was open to all male applicants in which the most ambitious and capable could succeed.
This applies to the army as well, because army rankings are now based on merit rather than caste.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed people of the working class in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond this worldly life. He often used a cave for contemplation, known as “Heera” (diamond) on the mountain of “Noor” (light).
They secluded themselves for a long period, which presents a very bright image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclination.
Located atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In reality, even if someone knows it exists, finding it isn’t easy at all. Once you enter the cave, you are completely alone.
Nothing can be seen but a clear atmosphere above, a beautiful sky, and many surrounding mountains. Therefore, only a small part of the world can be seen or heard from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures constructed to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, “Giza Necropolis” or the Valley of the Tombs of Egypt, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square with its bottom part missing.
Forward means you should start from the tip and push the bow, and backward means you should start from the frog (where you grip the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An up-bow generally produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write on your own markings, but remember that printed bowing marks also exist for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
Frightened, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles), along with the king’s sister Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of women in the market to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris travelling in a carriage surrounded by a shouting, screaming crowd protesting against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open their car window.
At one point, someone in the crowd, right before the panicked queen, shook the head of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forcing American street colonial rule to pay taxes, a large portion of which was to defraud the Philippine government through bonds imposed in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses via Phil Street government, and for expenses.
Certainly, the superfruits obtained from the exploitation of Filipino people will constitute a fundamental benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that inspired their formation.
The period in which these events occurred is generally identified in European history as the High Middle Ages, encompassing the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an inherent logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism revolve around two common ideas: that technological development has no cultural or political influence, and consequently, instead of being socially shaped, technology “impacts” societies that inherently possess it.
For example, one could say that the motor car necessarily affects the development of roads.
However, the network of roads spread across the country was not affordable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of buying a car.
The high rate of accidents on the roads is due to excessive car ownership, which has, in turn, spurred the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damage to the body.
Romanticism contained a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and customs and culture connected to that geography arose over time. Because these people conformed to the place of their society, they were far better off than with arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury from approximately 400 A.D. to 1100 A.D.
Its decline during the twelfth century was mainly due to the fact that warrior-pilgrims brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was the time when Paris was crowned the fashion capital, replacing Constantinople.
Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and reached its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, the attire was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture.
Due to slow communication channels, the lifestyle in the West could be 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is done only to meet the needs of the farmer and his family and to produce enough food.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that utilizes locally adapted, saved seeds and crop rotation or other relatively easy techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have practiced subsistence farming, and this continues to be the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Differences in subcultures may be due to the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture can be things like language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a mixture of many factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, manners, and specific dialects.
Some of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization are to draw attention to unfortunate cases of children who, while not neglected by adults during their upbringing, experienced deprivation, misfortune, or abuse.
Such children are called “feral” or wild. Some wild children are kept isolated from the world by people (mostly their parents). In some cases, parents do this due to a mental or physical deficiency in the children.
It is possible that the captive children experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being released or escaping.
Others were reportedly brought in by animals; some were said to be living in the forest on their own.
After being brought up on completely non-human animals, wild cubs behave almost identically (within physical limitations) to specially-reared animals, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding isn't a method of learning itself, but rather it’s helpful for people who are learning something new, like how to operate a new computer program or start a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual as well as real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are inherent to the software itself and they question, hint at, and provide information about processes that would be challenging for a student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even parental substance abuse.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring, and educational, but they are.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving care, consistent education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care is meant to fulfill all the needs that were not being met in the home they were brought from.
The internet combines elements of both people and interpersonal communication.
Different characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and satisfaction perspectives.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” were cited as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Amy and MacCord (1998) investigated audience responses on websites, “personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified as novel aspects that were inspiring.
The use of video recording to interpret micro-expressions—facial movements that last only a few milliseconds—has led to significant discoveries.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting a person's micro-expressions, one can understand whether they are lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper “The President’s Speech,” suggested how individuals who cannot comprehend speech due to neurological damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
They also suggest that the abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared even with animals like domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
The variation of isolation and recombination continues to go back and forth between two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, the available plants may be insufficient to meet the amino acid requirements of primates with human-like digestive systems.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Among the resources most easily obtained from plants are the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them without cooking.
Conversely, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
If our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” to some extent in a way similar to how chimpanzees do today, we shouldn’t be surprised.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking you up during your normal sleep duration and it subsides after a short time (10-60 minutes).
It can be easily done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking up.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other BioRad-based options include drinking a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, a common diuretic), which forces the person to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the level of tension present in their body and soul.
The less worry, the more positive life energy flows. Everyone can attain ultimate peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain knowledge. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is greatly enhanced by many techniques from the Mahayana path of love and Indian yoga.
Theoretically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of embracing everyone with love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of wisdom) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and mental focus/visualization.
Devayoga is the center of Tibetan meditation. Energy channels are cleared through depictions of various deities, chakras are activated, and a consciousness of enlightenment is cultivated.
Led by cooperation between the USSR and the USA, Germany was a common enemy in World War II. However, with the end of the war, countries began to fracture due to clashes of systems, processes, and cultures.
In the last two years of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and in reality, through proxy armies, it was to unfold on battlefields from Africa to Asia – in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had almost collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and then reunite with the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were devised almost overnight when the Soviet Union, having attacked and entered the eastern regions of Poland with over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army, established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts. They did so in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is a very effective way to bring and carry large quantities of people and goods from one end of the oceans to the other.
The traditional role of navies is to maintain the ability to transport their own country's people and goods from one place to another, and also to interfere with the ability of enemy nations to transport their people and goods.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were attempting to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U-boats.
If the Allied nations had failed, Germany would probably have defeated Britain because it had the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goat herding originated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep milk, hair, meat, and hides readily available to them.
Domestic goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tending towards the goat herds where children or adolescents were frequently found, much like a more widely known shepherd. These herding practices are still used today.
Waggons were built in England in the early 16th century.
However, wagonways typically featured uniformly wooden planks, but horses could pull them at faster speeds and carry larger loads on the somewhat rougher roads of those days.
Cross-ties were used quite early to keep the rails in place. But it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if there was an iron plate on top of them.
It became common practice, but iron vehicles wore down wooden wheels more.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron railway was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking; humans began walking two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedalism is evident in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although *Sahelanthropus* may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more friendly with the environment, by joining environmental movements, and we can even become environmental activists to save the future from some hardship.
This is much like treating the symptoms rather than the disease itself. However, if we don't want merely temporary solutions, we must find the root of the problems and neutralize them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humankind, and problems have increased due to a growing population and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson, and then sent to the printing shop of John Dunlop, a few blocks away.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Dunlop broadsides.”
The first public reading of the Declaration of Independence was done on July 8th in the yard of Independence Hall by John Nixon.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his army in New York on July 9th. A copy of it reached London on August 10th.
The existing 25 Dunlop Broadside documents are the oldest copies remaining. The original handwritten copy was not preserved.
Many paleontologists still believe that a group of dinosaurs survived extinction and lives on today – we call them birds.
Because of their wings and ability to fly, many people don't believe they are dinosaurs.
But there are many things about those birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is coded as binary numbers.
In a binary number, only one of two values can exist – that is, 0 or 1 – and these numbers are called binary digits, or bits in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning isn't immediately detectable. Its symptoms are common, such as nausea and vomiting, so it can’t be diagnosed quickly.
The best indicator of internal poisoning might be the presence of open containers of medicine or poisonous household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" formally for this group of insects.
This definition arose from the long-standing association with bedbugs, the most adaptable insects heavily reliant on humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nest-dwellers, capable of living within nests or a host's home without causing disturbance.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop MS compared to men.
A couple may decide that having another child is simply not in their or their child's best interest.
These couples can choose to consider adoption as an option for having a child.
In the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's guardians.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is based on this method.
Although it is not alone, experimentation—and experimentation is a test used to guide scientific research by eliminating, questioning, and observing one or more potential hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to classical texts and, in particular, to the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, are accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
It has been observed in many people in physical science and in practice, that inherent cycles often appear through biological clocks and depend on their production.
Such temporal rhythms that are not merely responses to external temporal cues have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-run oscillators that will continue a cycle of a certain period even in the absence of external signals.
A major suggestion from the Hershey-Chase experiment was that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage or virus to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, one involving labeling DNA with radioactive phosphorus and the other labeling protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ-line cells, mutations have a variety of different effects.
Only increases in germline cells can be passed on to children, while increases occurring elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism aims to attract people interested in viewing natural landscapes, including plants and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Going to Borneo, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans is an example.
People leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and the workplace is a place passed by others that they have just left.
Everyone on this dynamic transport shuttle is connected in some way, and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human development over the last two million years.
Everyone is connected to society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or issues like bridges collapsing to the same extent.
Why does the transportation system encourage such complaints? Why does it fall behind every day? Are the transportation engineers not capable? Or is there a bigger flaw within the system?
Traffic flow is the study of the activity of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the drivers maintain a reasonably consistent speed; thus, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic flow, and this can be roughly demonstrated mathematically.
To better demonstrate traffic flow, it is related to three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, designing, and operations of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily, and also find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
This gives them a very large range of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and damselflies are insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people used to think he was right, but many believed the opposite – that the solar system revolved around the Earth (and even other stars).
That seems logical, because it doesn’t feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the water of the next largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching widths of up to six miles.
20% of the water flowing from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller rivers flow into it.
Although pyramid construction from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the Giza pyramids and the technical excellence of their construction were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom Egyptians were awestruck by the monuments of their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the world's smallest independent nation with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian is also a language used daily, used by most people working in the state, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been aware of chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to find with basic tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proved that everything is made of a mixture of one or four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was much like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also established the theory that what appears to us can transform into even newer states of matter.
Alloys are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also take alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
All objects in the universe are made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called molecules.
Atoms are incredibly tiny—so small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil arrived, it was a good friend to many people.
It's a shame that as newer ways of writing have developed, the status and use of the pencil have gradually diminished.
People now type messages on computer screens; there’s no need to use a sharpener anymore.
No one can currently imagine what a keyboard will become with the advent of something new.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy vehicle up a hill. Re-splitting the nucleus and extracting some energy from it.
Some molecules have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no provocation.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
At the nearest point, the crust's thickness is around 70 kilometers, and at the farthest point, it is 100 kilometers.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker under high areas.
Due to the crust being thin, there would be many maria nearby. It was easy for lava to rise to the surface.
The core principle of content is focused on discovering what resonates with people or what attracts them.
These principles suggest that people had certain needs and/or desires that became ingrained within them as they matured into adulthood.
These theories explore what aspects of individuals compel them to do what they want, and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
There are two popular content theories: Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In simple terms, two kinds of behavior emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or one of the girls).
Such a manager struggles with making decisions different from everyone else’s thinking, taking disciplinary action, inspecting work, delegating responsibility, and establishing accountability for people.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone takes on the guise of a stranger who believes they should change everything about the team and reshape it according to their own vision.
Ultimately, a leader is responsible for the success and failure of their team.
This kind of behavior sometimes creates rifts between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences between them.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standard for each member.
Why would any organization choose to adopt the lengthy process of establishing a training organization? A key objective of putting the organizational training concept into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments, both creativity and simplicity become possible.
Consequently, a process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can be an innovative process for customer needs.
Before any organization can become innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation, as well as prepare for shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explained the continuum approach as the method used to help organizations reach higher levels of functioning.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigate cognition. Therefore, these limit the scope of research and make it much more precise.
Research supports scientists’ understanding of the connection between brain dysfunction and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain lesions, trauma, injury, and tumors affect certain mental behaviors and cause alterations in some mental functions.
With the advancement of new technologies, we can now investigate the structure and processes of the brain by observing things that have never been seen before.
This provides a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which helps us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, encompassing dealing with behavior, machine learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, customer diagnosis and answering questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, speech and faces.
These things have evolved into distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Nowadays, AI systems are frequently used in fields like economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as evidenced by their integration into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom experience. Teachers often prefer to take their students to places where a bus trip isn’t a viable option.
Technology also offers some solutions with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or appreciate fine art together while sitting in their classroom.
Actually, sharing a field trip is a great way to reflect on the journey and experience it with future classes.
For example, thousands of students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but some older versions are kept online for use as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with haphazard grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally leads to improvement.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a blog writer begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism or reviews.
Furthermore, blogging “forces students to be more aware of the world around them.” The need to satisfy audience interest motivates students to be quick-witted and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to learn better than with a traditional school day.
Effective use of blogs can empower “students to become more analytical and critical thinkers; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in relation to the writing of others, and also make their own perspectives on a particular topic public online” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s beautiful, bilingual capital and boasts numerous art galleries and museums showcasing Canada’s past and present.
Niagara Falls is in the far south. At the same time, natural beauty is scattered throughout Muskoka and other places in the north.
These things make Ontario even more significant, as foreigners fully identify as Canadian.
The population is very sparse over a large area to the north, and in some areas there is almost no human population at all.
To the surprise of many, when comparing populations: there are far more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, beyond the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island with its own unique wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
People from Arabia also brought Islam to this land, and widely spread it in Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, European influence and colonialism began, as Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bordered by the Sahel, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveler state that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
This is also useful for wearing a ring (it just appears very expensive).
Women should understand that due to cultural differences, they may face harassment, such as being followed or having someone forcibly grab their arm, and so on.
Firmly reject men and stand your ground without hesitation (cultural differences don't make it right, whether they exist or not!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, then known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it, renaming it Casa Branca, but it was abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Dar al-Badiya, but Spanish merchants, who established trading centers there, called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of babouches, but it’s all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located directly east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the Nyiragongo volcano’s lava, which buried most of the city’s roads, especially the central part of town.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, one should understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province when leaving Goma.
This city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the most affordable mountain gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. For a short trip, the (local) fare is usually around 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” began to be used as a metaphor for a far-off land.
Today, Timbuktu is a city lacking resources, although its reputation is built by its tourist attractions, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This was a major milestone during Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s PBS series on African wonders.
This city is different from the rest of the cities in the country because it feels more like an Arab city than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River along its southern border.
This park is spread over 19,500 square kilometers and has 14 different eco-zones, each of which has diverse wildlife.
This is one of South Africa’s major attractions and is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Daily conservation and entry fees are charged for all South African national parks, including this park.
Purchasing a Wild Card could also be beneficial, as it allows you to visit select parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the location many tourists consider the main focal point.
The parade of buildings that has made Hong Kong’s skyline resemble a glittering bar chart has made the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters a sight to behold.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite side, towards the Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is heavily concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place where British colonists built their settlement, and therefore, if you are looking for evidence of this place's colonial past, this is a good place to be.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove area, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hilly regions.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that lies in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the jungle doesn't just mean mangrove swamps – they are some of the last powerful forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
Sundarbans spans 3,850 square kilometers, of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and according to an estimate, there are now approximately 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in this area.
Buses run throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (which is across the river), although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to purchase tickets a few days in advance.
In most districts, small Japanese coaster buses operate which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana across the Oyapock River.
The height of both these towers is 83 meters. Their length is 378 meters, and they have two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, coinciding with the anticipated completion of Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most distinctive group of indigenous people inhabiting eastern Paraguay. These people lived a nomadic life and also farmed for their livelihood.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups such as the Guayakuro and Pegua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the “Great Province of the Indies,” was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The people of Spain initiated the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known worldwide for its excellent polo team and players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas polo ground.
Small tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and to purchase polo match tickets, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP). It is pegged at par with the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in these islands, located in Stanley opposite Fickling West Store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and on Stanley Credit Cards, and United States dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outer islands, although British and US currency will be; it’s best to ask owners beforehand to determine what payment methods are accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it experiences summer during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures exceeding +30°C are common.
The winter season can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than what the thermometer reads.
Here, there isn't a distinct "rainy" or "dry" season: rainfall remains fairly consistent throughout the year.
Although there are many animals in the park for people to see, wildlife remains dangerous and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters away from other wildlife.
It doesn't matter how gentle they appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and nearly all animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don’t keep a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so maintain your distance from them.
In addition, be aware that sulfur attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. This city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, this port was the site of a notorious naval deadlock, at which time Germany, America, and Britain each refused to let seven of their ships depart from it.
All ships sank except for one British cruiser. Around 200 American and German people died.
During the Mau Movement's struggle for independence, Chief Tapua Tamasese Celofī III was killed at a peaceful gathering in the town.
Because of being spread across Auckland's two harbors, there are many beaches here. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore, (in the North Harbour district), lies in the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches where swimming is considered safe. Most of them have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive is located along the Waitemata Harbour, in central Auckland, and exists in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops along the shores. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is ‘Number one’, it’s not a complex beer, but it gives you a refreshing feeling. Other local beers are called “Manta”.
Here you can find many kinds of French wine, but perhaps New Zealand and Australian wines would be better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is foreign. A 'short black' is an 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made to Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but very good.
Many trips to the reef are taken throughout the year, and due to any of these, the reef is only occasionally damaged.
Continue to consult with authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the coastal waters north of 1770 and in river mouths from October to April. They are often seen outside these months as well.
Sharks do exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles generally do not live in the open ocean. They are often seen at river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind knowing that at least after reaching their destination, they will have a place to rest.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, however, you can also book other accommodation options like campsites through a travel agent.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and hotel accommodations along with airline tickets.
If you need time to consider the offer or obtain documents for the destination (such as a visa), they can also offer you the convenience of a reservation.
Any modifications or requests, however, should be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most people attending music festivals choose to camp at the event location itself, and consider it an important part of their experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll need to get to the campsite near the music as quickly as possible.
Remember that even after the music stops on the main stage, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic in winter, you'll need to check the cabin space, because those who are more sensitive will feel quite a terrible noise when passing through the ice.
Spending time in the city is included in the St. Petersburg cruise port visit. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make several efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. They commonly lack windows and clocks, and finding the way out can be quite difficult.
Typically, they arrange for special food and drink and entertainment, so that their guests are in good spirits and stay there.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages. However, judgment is impaired by intoxication, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes should keep in mind the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and you won’t be able to drive as you would on just asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility can also be reduced by snowfall or condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally flows without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist centers in Africa and attract many visitors.
The term "safari" is generally used to describe a trip to view the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna, in its entirety.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes come very close to cars, and a better view will be visible than with standard equipment.
Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy. You will be able to see them well with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a “bush walk”, “hiking safari”, or “pedestrian safari”) involves hiking for a few days or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24, 2021 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the Games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, this could be a difficult situation for you.
Cancellation policies may differ, but most policies cancelling based on coronavirus in late March weren’t extended beyond July 2020 – that is, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Damp clothes can be ironed to dry them. Many hotels offer clothes irons and ironing boards on loan, even if these items aren't in the room.
If an iron is unavailable, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you could consider using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or may catch fire if overheated).
There are many ways to purify water, and some are effective in reducing specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and you should consider this first, then you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers encounter animals and insects they are not familiar with in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergies, spread venom, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Tourists living in high-tax countries can sometimes save quite a bit, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions, as the route often passes through a desolate, wooded area.
If you are not accustomed to driving on the country's roads, keep the following information in mind: Steep gradients, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than before—typically 35-40 mph (56-60 km/h)—and stricter enforcement of those limits is greatly needed.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is actually better here than on many other parts of the Pennsylvania Wilds trail.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria, similar to its southern neighbor Austria, they are quite rich and diverse.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples baked into them year-round, and cherries and plums appearing during the summer months.
Many German baked goods include almonds, walnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes often pair well, especially with strong coffee.
If you're looking for some small but nutritious pastries, you can try Berliners, pancakes, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made by combining meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.
Depending on the liquidity, a curry can be “dry” or “wet”.
In North India and inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is typically used.
Comprising over 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a broad term encompassing the diverse range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without the qualifier "extra," this word refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese dishes are now widely available throughout the archipelago, characterized by a distinctive flavor profile where peanuts, chilies, sugar (particularly Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices play a prominent role.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down from both sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability to the driver but can raise safety concerns due to the possibility of a driver’s feet getting caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along as the horse runs away. To mitigate this risk, several safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear heels and smooth, fairly thin-soled riding boots.
Following this, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety straps where a stirrup leather detaches from the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backwards.
The Cochamó Valley – in Chile – is a special climbing spot, also known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring steep cliffs and a variety of granite walls.
From the peaks, breathtaking views stop you in your tracks. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes amidst the endless possibilities of its walls.
Hillside snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities that involve gliding across snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called “ski bums,” who plan entire vacations around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depict skiers dating back to 5000 BC.
Downhill skiing began as a sport as early as the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related, but generally doesn't involve alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, which is done on steep terrain and requires very aggressive skis and boots.
Think of a ski run like a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you’ll be able to cover a somewhat greater distance while walking – but only a very small fraction will reach the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared trails without a heavy pack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but it contains many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries means going through the visa application and passport control process multiple times.
However, the Schengen Zone functions somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you reside in this region, you can generally cross borders without ever going through passport control checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for separate visas for each Schengen member country, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antique goods. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.

Barasingha farming is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this trade is also important for other businesses.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami were extensively involved in reindeer herding, but rather made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, keeping reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern businesses, and tourism is a very important part of the income in Sápmi, which is inhabited by the Sámi people.

As an example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different kinds of situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory is merely a brief description of the political situation in any country.
The perspectives presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a broad term for any hazardous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.

Pre-operative transgender individuals should not expect to be able to pass through scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rill currents are the flow of returning waves that strike the beach, often against a rock or similar substance.
Due to underwater topography, return flow concentrates in some deep sections, and from here, fast currents can occur in deep water.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from swimming against the current, and it may even be impossible.
As soon as you exit the current, it's not particularly difficult to swim back.
Move towards a location where you won’t get stuck returning, or, depending on whether your skills have been noticed or anyone is looking for you, you might want to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock comes sooner than the initial culture shock (the honeymoon phase wears off), it lasts longer, and can be more severe.
For travelers who had a good opportunity to adjust to a new culture, it is sometimes particularly difficult to cope with their original culture.
After living abroad and returning home, you have often adopted a new culture and lost many habits of your own culture.
When you traveled abroad in the past, people were patient and understanding knowing that travelers needed time to adjust to a new country.
People cannot realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area designed for children.

Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are shown.
South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and host the highest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George is the largest island, with residential areas like Villas Las Estrellas.
Other locations include Livingston and Deception Island, where the caldera of an active volcano still forms an excellent natural harbor.
To the south of the Peninsula lies Ellsworth Land, which is bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peninsula’s mountains converge here into a plateau, then rise again to form a 360-kilometer-long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cleaved into two parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or Sentinel Range of Antarctica are the highest mountains, Vinson Massif and Mount Vinson, with the highest peak reaching 4892 meters.
In remote locations, where cell phone coverage is unavailable, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Generally, a satellite phone cannot be used in place of a mobile phone, as you would need to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
This service is commonly used by shipping companies, including small, navigable vessels, as well as for operations requiring remote data and voice services.
Keep in mind that your local telephone service provider may be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For gap year planners, traveling and learning is a more popular option.
It is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to exit university a year early without compromising their education.
In many cases, gaining admission to a one-year gap course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into a higher education course in your own country.
Typically, tuition fees must be paid to enroll in these academic programs.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in island groups and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, a completely different experience is gained from small boats or kayaks.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one to forty).
Most specialized Baltic cruises have offered extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historical city for a few days and sleep on the ship at night on your way back.
You will not require a separate visa if you go ashore only using ship excursions (until 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany. As you can see in the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by airplane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event during air travel.
There’s no need to be ashamed of this: it’s no different from personal fears or other dislikes that anyone can experience.
For some, understanding how planes work and what happens during flight can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are paid to deliver goods quickly and in good condition. Often, the timely delivery of business documents, commercial goods, or spare parts used for repairs plays a very important role.
On select routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for smaller firms, it’s a problem.
If they ship items via air freight, it may take a few days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get it there quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations wouldn’t allow them to ship baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
Traveling in First or Business class is spending more money for convenience (or, it’s better to have your company book it).
However, it isn't cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
It is generally said that direct flights rarely, if ever, offer discounts on Business or First Class seats from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a segment of passengers willing to pay a premium for somewhat faster and more convenient travel, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.

If you show some basic courtesy, people from outside Paris will quickly disappear.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is surrounded by dense forests, primarily of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and here you find alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its nuanced microclimates, varied soils, and differing altitudes, it boasts a wide diversity of vegetation.
