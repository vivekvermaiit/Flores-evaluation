Those who call themselves bloggers, wanting to improve, should learn from the wise as if from a better school, and not think of the old teachings as being from a former school.
Blogs, it seems, are good for learning, stating “showing the ability to skillfully weave a good story, reducing the surface of the internet to share experiences, and for however much learning there may be, to be able to reach many places” (Oravec, 2002).

The Guarani people, who were once called indigenous people of the most beautiful town, currently live in the Chaco region of Paraguay, living like hunters and despite being numerous, they continue to survive, however, they persist in the cultivation of chacra (small farm).
The Chaco region was once the dwelling place of many families, with a macaw and a parrot, creating their lives by shaping something, blossoming and waiting for the eagles to come.
