This doesn’t just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – a theory already well-known – but that fossils generally haven’t been presented with details like color and three-dimensional design.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top with a pale or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of nearby plumage.
Because dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed central shaft, called a ‘rachis’, but did possess other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – the researcher deduced that the ‘rachis’ was likely a later development in evolution than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used during flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy plumage.
The investigators suggested that, even though this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not downy plumage.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, and place a paper that is freshly printed with their chosen candidate’s indication into an envelope.
After the employees verify the voter's identity, the voter casts the envelope into a ballot box and signs the voting list.

Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following a specific procedure.

Schneider testified via a video link to a USAF base in his country.
Besides the event on Tuesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual tournaments at the championships.
His first was the Slalom, where he had a Did Not Finish in his first run. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in the run.
In her other race, the Giant Slalom, she finished as number ten in the group of women with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the one who finished in first place, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the one who finished in ninth place, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group remained without finishing their runs, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom remained unclassified in the run.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and the cell phone.
Acting Inspector General D.K. Arya stated, “We have arrested five people who violated the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop.”
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court in handcuffs.
Although there were three people in the house when the car drove in, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The reason the road was blocked was temporarily while emergency services were extracting the driver from the crashed Audi TT.
Initially, she was placed at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.
He is due to appear in Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of murdering his son.
He will likely be facing charges and a case in court, but all eyewitness testimony could be compromised because his photo has been published widely.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts viewed the publication of portraits as potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “it seems as if a journalist is walking a dangerous path if they publish portraits etc. of a suspect.”
The Crown Office, which is fully responsible for the prosecution, indicated to the journalist that it would not give any further comment, at least until the accusation.
The document, according to the law, will refer to the border dispute with Palestine, based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Another topic that was covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once it signs the agreement, while the PA agrees to allow this presence for only five years.
The court-appointed guardian of animals had to supervise the trapping in the supplementary case of the harmful animal control meticulously, as they monitored the case in court and evaluated its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and the Archery Australia (NSW) Inc Association, qualified volunteers were recruited through the Association's mentorship program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the Deputy Director of Conservation and Heritage of the Park with NWPS, the four divers selected for the first salvage operation have received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
Martelly has been the director of CEP for four years.
Following a presidential commission, the retirement of the previous Central Electoral Board was recommended as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests were caused by the failure to hold elections, which should have taken place instead of 2011.
Reports indicate over 60 cases of iPod malfunctions that overheated, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Yesterday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported knowing about 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company has declared “not serious.”
The ministry responded, calling Apple’s postponement of the report “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT yesterday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage during the hijacking of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
They rescued several hostages and so far have confirmed at least 6 people dead.
They freed six hostages, including children, adults, and the Filipino photographers.
After the photographers took the place of a large person who needed to use the restroom, they pulled Mendoza down dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at National Women’s Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While he was working at Liggins Hospital, he started researching childbirth extensively in his free time.
The research shows that giving this hormone would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs while in the mother's womb.
Xinhua reported that a government investigation discovered two flight recorders, “black boxes,” yesterday.
Her companions who fought also honored Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the new moon. Truly unique, just like herself. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “The moon was so strange with me… maybe even more… I know it and I will miss her… I hope she is in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people who were polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign said she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the people in the poll share this idea, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those polled find that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 meter freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his physical condition, his health was in doubt.
He cannot take the necessary medications to treat his pain, because these are prohibited on the Roads.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number to date on January 25th.
Different people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water supply for Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are hoping to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, from the time comets impacted Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began as governor earlier this year and last month signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as “child's play and political nonsense.”
He was rumored to be aiming for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims can allow airplanes to fly more direct routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older radar-based technology on the ground to allow air traffic controllers to mark an aircraft's position with more precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
They will not provide extra transport, and the trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and drop-off facilities will not be available at the location.
The fear of a lack of transportation has increased the possibility that the game behind closed doors will be played without the team's fans.
A study published Wednesday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to the hybridization between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch immigrant, Geospiza conirostris.
It can take on all sorts of shapes. It can even be in a very small form.
To make it, you need a thin wire that can be bent and flexed. You can hit it with a hammer or bend it on a smooth surface.
It can be made very fine, but it’s glued onto another metal. It can be made so fine that it was used to decorate hand-painted plates in a book called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This measures the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of a solution changes color depending on whether the chemical substance is acidic or basic (alkaline).
It indicates the pH level with the quantity of Hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance that was tested.
Ions of hydrogen are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with a clean hand, carefully work them together to form a ball with them.
The moisture from your hands will react with the flour above, which will feel strange and will form a type of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets that could flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
They found the remains of a drainage system in the homes of the cities of Minoa in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were toilets also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, tiled toilets were part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in each other's company.
If you call someone who is a thousand of my league, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
They send satellites into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts our light and vision.
You need a giant racket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
He wants to change the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing he wants to do for us is to give us easier and faster transportation.
He gave us trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Among them, there are more medium-sized feline animals that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and iguanas.
Finally, there are many small feline animals (including house cats) that eat small prey in very large quantities, such as insects, lizards, and mice, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that each small business has which ensures it doesn't compete with other small businesses.
Lion is the most social feline animal, hunting in large groups called prides.
The troop consists of one to three adult males, together with up to thirty female lions and young.
Women traditionally tend to be close to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion’s troop behaves a lot like a wolf or dog pack, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
Like a good athlete, a tiger can climb (not very well though), run, swim long distances very easily, and pull with its teeth with much more strength than people.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four feline animals are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full sound of a lion’s voice, but more like a phrase of whispered words and screams.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. They eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and anything else they can catch. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by means of their scent, smelling where they were previously on the ground.
They can see very well in the darkness with the eyes of the night, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots pounce on their prey, hiding in their surroundings before suddenly leaping on their prey.
If a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the larger population they came from (for example, if they cross over a chain of hills or a river, or if they move to a new island in a way that they can’t easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different sources of support and different competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor as they needed to be before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they start to perceive the other populations less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, which simply means the formation of a new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants work to create oxygen that people inhale, and they take carbon dioxide that people exhale (this happens in their leaves).
Trees make food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We are building our homes and our shelters from wood. Most of the food we eat comes from trees. Without trees, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the most ferocious beast of its time, so much so that it feared nothing, with the exception of other mosasaurs.
Her jawline was long and filled with more than 70 sharp teeth like blades, along with an extra set in her mouth, meaning there was no escaping anything she bit down on.
We don't know for sure, but perhaps it had a tongue shaped like a fork. It ate turtles, large fish, more like a mosasaurus, and perhaps it was even a cannibal.
It was also attacking whatever was in the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn't have been able to cope.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or exceptionally flavorful foods, including dormice pork, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a ‘dormouse’.
Another difference was that while poor people and women would eat their food sitting on stools, the wealthy men liked to have their banquets together, lying on their sides while they ate their food.
Food from ancient Rome could not have contained edibles that entered Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor pumpkins, nor did any ancient Romans ever try to cook them.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a great temple, which they considered the house of the god.
In the old days, people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests were responsible for attending to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes towers with a special shape like a pyramid, called ‘ziggurats’, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't as important.
Most of the Jewish family’s worship took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the dark, the shops were simply stalls open to the street. They used stones to make ovens.
There were no large worlds in the land of Canaan, therefore it was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. During the Norwegian sagas it is said that he sailed with Erik the Red into exile from Iceland for the reason of murder, and during his voyage in a westerly direction, he reached Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were still living there at that time.
Despite the fact that each nation was of ‘Scandinavia’, there were many differences between the people, rulers, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a treasure map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, this was not a treasure map.
The margins of the Declaration of Independence contain the words “Declaration of Independence Original signed July 4, 1776”. The text appears above the document, at the top.
While no one knows for sure who wrote this, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (which measured 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was already faded in places, as if to protect what it contained.
Well, they probably just put the note as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unliberated.
The French “Vichy” regime was in power. There were people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the southern part of France, and the invasion was called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated the northern part of France and began advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a particular culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from *civilis* in Latin, meaning civil, related to *civis* in Latin, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and in one way or another these also define the size of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across different generations, a persistent cultural mark, and a just distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judicial power, it depended on the authority of the states, which often did not cooperate, to implement all its laws.
It also lacked the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The arrangement of the Articles of Confederation required unanimous agreement from all the states before they could be amended, and the states did not take the central government very seriously, with their representatives frequently absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, are the two most victorious teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international races and Olympic events.
Japan consists of 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world!
The pain of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, is often referred to as Japan, on a geographical level, as an “archipelago”.
Taiwan’s recorded history began in the 15th century when European navigators passing by registered the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southeast part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of native wheat production practices and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western part of Taiwan and the areas of the northern coast and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, they are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
They reconstructed most of the buildings around the complex to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Since 1976, they have reconstructed thirty percent of Machu Picchu and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the photographic format of a standard, widely-used image in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Today it is being produced, but more importantly, the digital camera's format sensor inherited its image proportion.
The 35mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect of the proportion of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a more easily understood whole number proportion) indicates that it is 3:2.
Many common formats (like APS family formats, for example) are the same thing or almost the same thing as the aspect ratio approximately.
The rule of a third party who often abuses it and is frequently ridiculed, is simply a guide to create dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
It is said that the most effective place for the main object is a grid of lines that divides the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of golden history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, fell prey to critical investigation.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its power, which penetrates every corner, has affected everyone from king to common citizen.
One of the major Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are specifically intended for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been established in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and capital here led many people to question whether this was consistent with the basic principles.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy appears to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though these blockades violate international law generally accepted and codified by various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to some neutral ships.
Fearing a limited response to this tactic, Germany considered a similar reaction in its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of many citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelties of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each phase of China or each family in power had a different dynasty.
Even among each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods is the Era of Three Kingdoms, taking place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce struggles took place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the understanding that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution opportunities were open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful ones to achieve their goals.
Nowadays, things count for soldiers because instead of rank and positions in the army being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class or from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He frequently visited a cave known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
His struggle, having survived those times, gives a vivid image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Situated on the head of one of the northern mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it’s not easy to find yourself even though you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it’s total isolation.
You won’t see anything else but the clear shell, beautiful shell above, and the many secrets that surround it. Few things of this world can you see or hear in the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the only remaining of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
Built for the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or “Giza Necropolis” in the Western Egyptian Valley, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
They built the Great Pyramid to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, the tombs, and the temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and members of his family.
The “arrowhead mark up” shows like a V and the “arrowhead mark down” shows like an n or a square without its lower side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the reel, and down means you have to start at the handle (which is where you hold the reel with your hand) and pull the reel.
A high arc generally creates a softer sound, while a low arc is harder and louder.
Feel free to write in your own notes, but remember that the bow markings are printed for a musical reason, so they generally must be respected.
Startled, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a multitude of people shouting and expressing threats against the King and Queen.
The multitude of people forced the King and Queen to open the windows of the large, spacious carriage.
At a given moment, a member of the crowd rushed at the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the Queen who was terrified and speechless.
The costs of the American imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, to finance a large part of the expenses and the interest on the bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking companies.
Naturally, the profits derived from the large-scale exploitation of the Filipino people will form the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is generally known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The Early Middle Ages period was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the late part of the Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is determined by a logic underlying its association with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has inherent “effects” on societies, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the car necessarily leads to the development of the road.
However, a stretch of road anywhere in the country is not economically accessible to just any car, which means they are developing new production methods to reduce the cost of owning a car.
A high prevalence of cars also leads to more car accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for bodies that have suffered damage.
Romanticism had a strong element of determination, stemming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped identities, and with time, the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the social position, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until 1100 A.D.
Its status as a bay during the 12th century was mainly due to the fact that participants of the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk fabrics and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Capital of Fashion took place from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style became very popular during the period between the 10th – 11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was under the strong influence of the Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to the slow communication of the channels, fashion in the west is running with 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Western European Middle Ages, it began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was a result of the Crusades, with many people starting to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture for the production of enough food to sufficiently meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native seeds that have been preserved from the ecosystem combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers practiced self-sufficient agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures are three individuals together with the same thought who feel neglected by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often demonstrate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic form of style usage, which includes fashions, customs, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, hardship, or intentional abuse, were unable to be socialized through adults during their development.
We call children like these “feral” or abandoned. Some feral children were raised by people (generally their own parents); in some of these cases, the abandonment of these children was due to the parents' rejection because of a child’s severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Children who are angry may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Giants were supposedly created by beasts; some believe they lived in the world on their own.
Since they were raised completely by animals, not humans, the feral children exhibit behaviors (within their physical limitations) almost completely like those of the particular animals that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards human beings.
While instruction based on projects should make teaching easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method but rather a support that provides assistance to individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of support, but the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office is too.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and has the goal to question, motivate, and explain the procedures that could present themselves as a challenge for the student to act upon independently.
There are many children in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that doesn't provide nourishment, love, and education, but this happens anyway.
We are working to ensure that the family upbringing system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is expected to provide a safe home, caregivers who nurture children with love, stable education, and reliable medical care.
Families fostering children must provide everything the children lacked in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage focus and gratification.
For example, “significance” and “socialization” are suggested as important aspects of motivation for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationship” are also aspects of new motivation that Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video grabbing has led to three important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that can last a couple of milliseconds.
Specifically, it is affirmed that you can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document The President’s Speech, indicates how people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can nevertheless understand sincerity appropriately.
It is now suggested that types of skills like interpreting human behavior could be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination drive variation by what happens between the two groups with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, failing to do this has serious consequences: delayed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resource would have been the proteins available in tubers and roots, but this is difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking them.
In contrast, animal foods (insects, caterpillars, crabs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep quickly afterward (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively short timer to bring you back to awareness without fully waking you up from sleep.
If you dream about constantly resetting your alarm in your dream, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room, that will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another option based on biorhythms is to involve drinking plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, known to stimulate urination) before going to sleep, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
But despite the tension, a positive life force is present. Every person has the potential to find peace and absolute satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded by the path of love of the Mahayana and the incorporation of many techniques of Yoga from India.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that contains everything.
With Kundalini Yoga, the energy of Kundalini (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the illumination of consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and America. With the end of the war, the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures led to the end of the cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
He spent the next 40 years hardened and went to be brought into real battles, for representative exercises, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and their only hope was to withdraw and reorganize with the Romanian fortifications.
However, this plan became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Korean People's Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the regions east of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using boats to transport products is one of the most efficient ways to move large quantities of people and products across the ocean.
The work of the seas traditionally was to ensure your country maintained its ability to transport its people and products, while at the same time, interfere with your enemy’s ability to move their people and products.
One of the most recent and remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same moment, the German navy, using primarily submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It began approximately 10,000 years ago to domesticate goats in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The culture and ancient tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
They used to keep domestic goats generally in numbers that would often roam on hills or grassy areas, often cared for by goat herders who were frequently children or adolescents, comparable to the shepherd as more widely known. This herding method is still used today.
In the 16th century, they built a horse-drawn tram in England.
Masks with the horse-drawn trams consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the roads a little further into the day.
They initially introduced rails with a cross connection just long enough to keep the rails in place. However, they gradually realized that the rails could be more efficient if they had a pointed tip on the upper part.
This became a common practice, but the welding caused the most damage to the wooden supports of the wagons.
Eventually, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rail was introduced.
The first form of transportation known was walking, people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (people standing on their bodies).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not eat meat regularly.
In the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, specializations were found that were on two feet, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two feet from seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly with the environment, we can unite with the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering to a certain degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we must seek the root of the problems, and we must deactivate them.
It is sufficiently obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, a rough draft was sent by hand and signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to the printing shop of John Dunlap just a few doors down.
During the night, I printed between 150 and 200 copies, now known as “Dunlap Broadsides”.
The first time someone read the document publicly was by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
On July 6th, one was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, a copy arrived in London.
The 25 “Dunlap broadsides” still known to exist are the oldest copies preserved of the document; the original of the copy in hand has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them para.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things regarding snakes that still seem like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back feet like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one or two values, which are 0 or 1, and in computer science terminology these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits.
Internal poisoning is not immediately evident. Symptoms, such as dizziness, are so general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term originates from the old knowledge of cama insects, which are insects that adapt very well to parasitizing humans.
Both the assassin bug and the bed bug tend to stay far from where they were born, adapting to live within nests or the homes of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), positioning it as the primary neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide it’s not in their best interest, or the interest of their child/children, to have a baby.
This couple can choose to work on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise their child.
The primary objective of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not solely through experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific investigations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, particularly, on the Bible in Latin.
He accepted all of Aristotle's viewpoints on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found its own path away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
For most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not simply reactions to periodically external signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators which, even without external signals, will continue to operate for a period within their free-running cycle.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the principal suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments tracing either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
The outcome can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including plants and free-roaming animals.
Examples of activities the site includes are yachting, fishing, taking photos, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people abandon small towns in cars to go to their jobs while others whose work destination is the place they just left pass them by.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is connected, in one way or another, to and supports a transportation system based on family cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has expelled the biosphere from one of its stable states that sustained human evolution during the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In the countries developed, very little time passes before you hear about levels of contamination similar regarding water quality or the types of waste that fall [into it].
Why do transport systems generate these bottlenecks, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically, more or less.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade predators, search for food, and reproduce more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to double their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a wider opportunity to hide in smaller places from their natural enemies.
Today, the only insects that cannot bend their wings backwards are butterflies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
There are people who thought it was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System moves around the World, including the Sun (and even the other planets).
This shows wisdom, because the world doesn't feel the way it's moving, or does it?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river and the largest in the world by discharge volume. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, with a length of six million meters.
A full 20 percent of the water that falls far from the planet's gathering in the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the construction of the stone pyramid continuing to the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, by that time more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language that the majority of those who work for the government use daily, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these can be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to obtain with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is a matter of substance. All substance is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that ions can pass through the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was a good friend to many people when it ran out, you know.
Unfortunately, according to newer methods of research, the potlot had degraded to a lower status and use.
Nowadays people write messages on the computer screen, without ever having to go near a typewriter.
Someone can only guess what will happen with the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom works according to the principle that energy is needed to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It feels like swallowing a heavy stone on a hill. From splitting the nucleus, at that moment it releases some of its energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nucleons, which means they have a tendency to break apart from each other with a small push or no push at all.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The waterfall is approximately 70 km deep on the near side and 100 km deep on the far side.
It is thinner than the seas (dark brown streaks on the moon) and thicker than the most mountainous parts.
There will be more fish on the windward side because the reef is shallower. It was easier for the schools of fish to come up to the surface.
The theories of content focus on discovering what motivates people or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature and become adults.
These theories look at what things are close to certain people who put their desires into the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally possible, behaviors can arise when managers start guiding their former peers. One extreme of the spectrum is trying to become “one of them.”
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, executing disciplinary actions, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable for damages.
At the extreme of the other spectrum, the person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything they have done and had done in their life.
Ultimately, the leader is the one who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior is very likely to result in division between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are just as high in standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as the point of contact for their direct physical groups.
They frequently have more autonomy with the members of conventional teams than with their teams being able to agree on the different time zones that their local management teams might not understand.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the team of management to whom each member reports. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Does it take an organization long to go through the process of establishing a learning organization? An objective to put the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively through an organization’s functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can manifest.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead them to a new process of innovation to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum process as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
That neurological evidence provides physical proof for a theoretical assertion of cognitive research. For this reason, it reduces the area of investigation and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between cerebral pathology and behavior is supported by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structure and processes of the brain like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong implication of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, signaling, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves working with machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and work schemes, the possibility to challenge diagnoses and similar client questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and face.
Recognizing equine-assisted therapy as separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Aurora supercomputer is frequently used in fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military service, and has also built various home computers and video game software applications.
The excursion is a large part of any reading location. Frequently, a teacher wants to take their students to places where a climb with a bus isn’t an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, they remodel the website every year, but they keep old versions online to serve as an album.
“Blogs” can also help improve students’ writing skills. While students often begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling as they are, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audiences, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
According to this, “blogging” obligates students to have more knowledge of the world around them. The need to feed the audience’s interest inspires students to be knowledgeable and interesting (Toto, 2004).
“Blogging” is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by reacting actively to materials on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others’ contributions and also delineate their own perspectives regarding particular problems (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and offers a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
But then there is Niagara Falls and to the north is the home of Muskoka's intact natural beauty and beyond.
Everything and all these things, and more, position Ontario as what people who come from abroad typically consider Canadian.
The large areas in the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that is very surprising: There are more African Americans living in the EU than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, opposite the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the other islands, and is a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious “beach resorts.”
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the countries, and this took great shape in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north and east, the island has Saba as its border, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all women who are traveling with men they are married to, regardless of their current marital status.
It's also useful to wear a dress (but not one that shows too much skin).
People must realize that cultural differences can result in what they might consider harassment, and it’s not uncommon for them to follow you, stare you down, etc.
Be strong in confronting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (whether cultural differences or not, this doesn't mean it's okay!).
The Berber fishermen founded the modern city of Casablanca in the 10th century AD, and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt much of what was known as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan reconstructed the city as Dar al-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it’s easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, like “tajine”, ceramics, leather goods, “hookah” and a whole range of “geegaws”, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, right next to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's infrastructure, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visits outside of Goma must be investigated to understand the security situation in the North Kivu province.
It is also the base for visiting the Nyiragongo volcano with some of the cheapest ways to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda boda (motorbike taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city even though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of invasive desert plants.
She was one of the main dancers during Henry Louis Gates' special program Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is in a notable contrast compared to the rest of the cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, the north of Zimbabwe, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each sustaining different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South Africa’s National Parks (SANParks).
Like all the National Parks of South Africa, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees for the park.
It could also be beneficial to purchase a “Wild Card,” which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place many tourists consider the main focus.
The skyline of buildings that forms the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a vibrant bar graph that becomes apparent due to the presence of the clouds of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head in the opposite direction of the Kowloon coast.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely populated on the reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place where the British colonizers took possession, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The “Sundarbans” is the world’s largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland into Bangladesh and India.
They declared the Sundarbans a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The parts of the forest within Indian territory are called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests, however, are not only havens for monkeys – they contain some of the last remnants of the mighty forests that once covered the “Gangetic” area.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are around 400 Bengal Royal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Due to high demand, the inter-district buses get full quickly, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
Most districts have the service of the small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and reliable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters wide and have two 3.50-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical span of the bridge is 15 meters high. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but its opening to traffic did not take place until March 2017.
The bridge was scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs control posts were expected to be completed.
The Guarani tribe was the most significant indigenous group that lived where today is eastern Paraguay, living as hunters and semi-nomadic people who also practiced self-sufficient agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to another group of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as “The Giant Province of Western India,” arose as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous natives.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain many aspects of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
We'll also see the smaller tournaments and parties at other times of the year.
For information regarding the tournament and where to purchase tickets for the polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which has a fixed equivalent value to the British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley they often accept credit cards and US dollars as well.
On the smaller streets off the center, they likely won't accept credit cards, however they may accept British and American currency; check in advance with the establishment owner which forms of payment they accept.
It is quite impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency off the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical area; during the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
The weather is disappointingly cool: the temperature is exceptionally low in the evenings, but the wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Despite the fact that many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the animals are nevertheless wild and should not be fed or stroked.
According to the park authorities' regulations, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Without taking into account how gently they can graze, bison, elk, deer, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they don't maintain an appropriate distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Furthermore, be aware that honey attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid cooking food with strong-smelling honey and keep a clean campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
It was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, America and England refused to abandon the harbor.
He sank all the boats, with the exception of a British cruise ship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is divided into two halves. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport, which is in the southern area.
Almost all of them are beaches with sand, and they are safe for landing, and most of them have shady spots with shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, within the affluent suburban area of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
This beach is for families that often get crowded, with a great variety of fish along the shore. It is safe for swimming.
The main local beer is ‘Number One’, it’s not a complex beer, but rather simple and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia will be better on the trip.
Tap water is perfect for babies, but bottled water is easier to find if you feel worried.
For Australians, the concept of a ‘flat white’ coffee is foreign. A ‘short black’ coffee is an ‘espresso’, cappuccinos come with a layer full of crema (not foam), and they are served even without milk.
Hot chocolate is the Belgian standard. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to go diving take place far out to sea, and the lessons caused by any of these regarding diving are very small.
However, take advice from the authorities, follow all instructions and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish are present near beaches and river mouths from October to April in the northern part of 1770. Occasionally they can be present outside of these seasons.
There are sharks present, however, very small ones often attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and they will swim away.
Bull sharks normally don't live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations alleviate the worry for the traveler about whether they will have a place to sleep once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, however you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies normally offer packages that include breakfast, arrangement of transportation to/from the airport, or even combinations of flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or if you need to sort out other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must go through the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a good spot near the music.
With the main stage masks and music completed, there are other sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are transporting livestock in the Northern Baltic region in winter, check the route with the cabin, because passage through ice can cause horrible suffering for the most traumatized.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money their guests spend. They usually have no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find the exits.
They usually have food, special drinks and offer entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and have them stay at the place.
The days of the week offer free alcoholic beverages. But drunkenness is a serious health hazard and every good driver knows the importance of staying within the limit.
All people who drive vehicles at high altitudes or on mountain roads should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On an icy and snowy road, friction is low and you can't drive as you would on smooth asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall to potentially keep you stuck for a very long time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic almost always continues to flow year after year without interruption.
Safaris are probably what attracts the most tourism to Africa and are the highlight for many visitors.
The word "safari" in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the magnificent African wildlife, particularly on the savanna.

There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific contaminants.
In some areas, water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are necessary.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying water in a bottle from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pests and animals unfamiliar to their home regions.
Fleas can damage food, cause irritation, or in a worse case cause allergic reactions, plasma poisoning, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually qualified as plagues.
Buying tax-free products is an opportunity to purchase products that are exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Traveling to countries with high taxes can sometimes result in a considerable amount of savings, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont contains the most direct conditions for running the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through lands in isolated and remote areas.
If you’re not used to running on country roads, keep your calm: perpendicular climbs, narrow paths, and sharp bends prevail.
Speed bumps and speed limits are noticeably more frequent than in the previous and following sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than in other cases.
Remarkably, however, cell phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the route, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their neighbors to the south, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apple being cooked in the bakery for years, and cherry and plum making their appearance during summer.
Many German cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other kinds of nuts. This popular cake often goes particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you find a small but delicious pastry, try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad term that covers a very wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the nation.
However, in the case that it is used without further specification, the term tends to mean the food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Widely available today throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of simply seasoned dishes, with the dominant flavors being those preferred in Java – peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stripe is supported by the brim that is glued on each side of the chair.
They provide greater stability for the current, but there may be some safety aspects due to the possibility of a current getting stuck in them.
If a towed vehicle is pulled out of a ditch but its tire remains stuck in the groove, it can be dragged along if the towing vehicle drives off. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, the horse must wear climbing shoes with a bridle and a gentle rein, just small.
Next, some days, particularly rainy days, have safety barriers that allow the stream bed to spill over the sides if it is pushed back by a current that collapses.
Cochamó Valley – Chile’s main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and big cliffs.
The peaks of the Serra da Estrela include impressive views from the highest points. Climbing practitioners from all over the world are continually creating new routes among the infinite potential of the walls.
Winter sports are popular, including skiing and snowboarding, which are sports involving gliding down a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.

Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Skiing with risks on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually involve the style of alpine skiing, ski touring, or ski mountaineering, the latter of which is done on perpendicular terrain and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good condition, you’ll be able to cover distances a little larger than running – but only very few times will you find the speeds of cross-country skiing without a route trodden on already prepared roads.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling from various countries would mean having to apply for visas and passport control several times.
The Schengen Area, however, functions like a country in that respect.
If you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, now that you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for the other Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There isn't a universal definition that describes when manufactured items are considered antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years old as antique.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit can be stricter in places like North America and Europe.
Fish hooks can be defined as antique, even if they are younger than similar products that were mass-produced.
The creation of brands is an important part of a business's life, and the culture related to the business is also important for many other professions.

Bad weather is the common term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disorder, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rain, and lightning are forming and are effects of severe weather, just like bad weather with thunder and lightning, whirlwinds, strong rain, and hurricanes.

A course will normally cover all the problems discussed here in much more detail, generally with practical experience.
A course is normally 2-5 days long and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife in nature are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.

Transgender people before surgery should not have to fear passing through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The ocean current is the flow that returns from the waves that break on the beach, often to a reef or something similar.
The pain of the underwater topology around the outflow and return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a strong current to go deeper can form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to fight against the current, which can be impossible.
Just as the salt floats on the current, life has not become more difficult than usual.
Before focusing on a path you won't revisit in the current, or, depending on your skills and if they've noticed you, you might be able to wait for rescue.
Reverse culture shock affects you more lightly than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is less), it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
People who adapt easily to a new culture often have difficulty readjusting to their original culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your habits from your own culture.
Now that you went abroad initially, people were likely understanding and showed patience with you, knowing that a traveler in a new country has to adapt.
People may not be anticipating, but patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The light and sound show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Most of the time you always hear the noise of tourists and the selling of things. The history of sound and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx functions as the backdrop and narrator of a vast story.
It shows the shadows on the pyramids and light is cast on the different pyramids.
The Sluiter Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have several nations claiming they have the majority base, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago remains 120 kilometers north of the Peninsula. The largest one is King George Island with the colony of Villa Las Estrellas.
Another includes Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The peaks of this Peninsula are connected to the terrace, after which they come together again to form the 360-kilometer-long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range contains Antarctica’s highest peaks, Vinson Massif, with the summit Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote areas, without cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a cell phone, because you must be outside with a direct view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
Boat owners frequently use this service, including recreational boats, and also expeditions that require data and voice communication over long distances.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information regarding connection to this service.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular with people who have just finished school, giving them a year to travel abroad before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad for a year in between can truly increase your opportunities to enter higher education when you return to your country.
Typically, there is a fee to register for these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for navigation. The country “of a thousand lakes” also consists of thousands of islands, in the lakes and on the archipelagos along the coast.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and lagoons.
With the archipelagos on the coast and the largest lagoons, it is truly large enough to offer a different experience for any yacht, smaller boat, or even a kayak.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This figure is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but uniquely its own (for example, in the Netherlands the figures are one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days while at night you return and sleep on the boat.
If you only disembark from the ship using the ship's excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
There’s a cruise that mentions Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on this map here, Berlin isn’t even close to the sea and a visit to the city isn’t included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they haven’t flown before or if they’ve experienced a traumatic event.

For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
It’s worth paying a good courier company to deliver things quickly. Frequently, time is very important with business documents, merchandise, or parts needed for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the largest companies had their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they send things with air cargo, on some routes it could take days to pass through unloading and customs.
The only way to pass it through lighter is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won’t allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so here your part begins.
It's obvious that flying first class or business class means spending a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, this doesn't come cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and thirteen times for first class!
Generally, there is no point in seeking a reduction for seats in business or first class on a direct flight from A to B.
Airlines are good at having a group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving light and comfortable, therefore they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the Transnistrian Republic, which proclaimed itself in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties between the two sides of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.

Please remember that you are essentially visiting a cemetery, and also a site that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
Still, many men and women are alive who survived that time, and many more who had owners who wanted to kill them or make them work until they died, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat this site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site with markings or graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona’s official languages are Catalan and Spanish. More or less half of them prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most sources indicate only Catalan, because according to law it is established as the first official language.
The bus is also widely used by Spanish speakers in public transportation and other facilities.
Announcements are regularly made in the Metro only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced via an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though many believe this is just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with others in Paris is still to behave excellently, to act like someone who is “well-bred” (well-raised). This will make your stay considerably easier.
The rough exterior of the Parisian quickly evaporates if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests with beech and spruce trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of forest communities, due to its scale of microclimates, different types of soil and varying altitudes.
The area is also the habitat of an extremely wide variety of animals and birds.
Rare mammals like brown bears, wolves, eagles, lynx, wild boars and capercaillie (wood grouse) can be found here, along with many other less common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear a skirt that covers their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer veils to cover the heads of women who don't come prepared, but if you bring your own, especially a brightly colored one, you’ll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In this month, men must wear clothing that covers their knees.
It's possible this swimsuit is also part of the assortment at the entrance, but they don't wash the towels after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these swimsuits. For men, size six fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like those of similar areas in the Mediterranean region, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil in everything.

Without a doubt, it makes learning easier, although writing is a little complicated due to the need to know whether to use a verb or adjective in a noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters that must be paid attention to in them are c, i, and g, as their pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also practice pronouncing 'r' and 'rr' differently: a dear thing that I love, while a car that I push.
Persiano has a relatively easy grammar and is mostly regular.
Reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
If you can speak a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, someone who knows a little Spanish can conclude with certainty that it is so close to Portuguese that it is not possible to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually old today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Unlike light pollution, which was a problem when they were important, it’s not the same type of problem as it is today; many times they are located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes greatly benefit from areas with low light pollution and favorable atmospheric conditions.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Animals show their best behavior when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even “just one” specimen.
If you visit a formally equipped garden, collecting "specimens" will also get you kicked out, no discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to find your way around, and you can buy almost everything once you arrive.
But since it is located in the tropical area, just a few degrees north of the equator, you must deal with so much heat (always) as only sharp (when the sky is clear, less common).
There are also some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional site of the burial of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you are thinking of taking goes into Hebron and not just the Jewish settlement nearby, called Kiryat Arba.
Little hands can be a good theme for planning a vacation with them.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or take a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube or navigate the Erie Canal.
They are also defining routes that are popular for walking, running, or biking.
Christmas is one of the most important festive days for Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
People who are not believers in Christian countries and non-Christian people around the world have also adopted many of the traditions surrounding the holiday.
We have a tradition to spend Easter Sunday night standing in an exposed place to watch the sun rise.
Of course, there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
However, many traditional churches hold a Maundy Thursday Mass of the Resurrection on Holy Thursday during the Easter weekend, where congregations often begin celebrations at 12 midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by landing, swimming, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals couldn't make the journey, and thus the giant tortoise became the primary herbivore on the Galapagos Islands.
When people arrived at the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals including goats, donkeys, cows, pigs, rabbits, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic area in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for about 24 hours a day.
Since there aren’t many people living in these areas, and light pollution for that majority is usually not a problem, you can also enjoy the beaches.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
They behave like professional standard traitors, and colleagues call each other by their first names or their job titles.
Harmony in work is crucial, emphasizing teamwork over praising individual achievement.
