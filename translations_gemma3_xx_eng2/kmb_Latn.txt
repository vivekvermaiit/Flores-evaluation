Here's the most accurate translation I can provide, keeping in mind nuances might be lost without deeper cultural understanding: "The spirit of the ancestors speaks strongly about the importance of traditional values and customs, saying they are good for both the Black people and the White people, and for all other people as well." **Explanation of key elements and choices made in the translation:** * **Bhoxi dyawu:** "Spirit of the ancestors" – *Bhoxi* generally refers to a spirit or voice, and *dyawu* specifically relates to ancestors. * **kwakala dingi:** "speaks strongly" or "says emphatically." *Kakala* means to speak, and *dingi* emphasizes the strength of the speech. * **yama ya itala ya kaxaxe:** "about traditional values and customs." This is the core of the message. *Itala* refers to customs and traditions. *Kaxaxe* reinforces the idea of established ways of life. * **yamudya we:** "they are good for" – A common Kimbundu construction to express benefit. * **yama kala yasokela ni mabhulu ndu ni yasokela ni jingulungu:** "for Black people and for White people." *Mabhulu* typically refers to Black people, and *jingulungu* to White people. *Yasokela* means "is good for" or "benefits". * **mba jimbambi:** “and for all other people as well” - *Jimbambi* means others. It's important to note that Kimbundu often carries a deeper, more metaphorical meaning than a direct translation can convey. This translation aims to capture the central message of the sentence as accurately as possible.

"Kitakanesu" denotes separation, division. The rest describes a shift from a positive ancestral state ("ukexilu kyolundule" – a good/blessed place) to a problematic one ("ukexilu wa ividilu ya izuzumbya ya jikamala jamilembu" – a place affected by unmet ancestral duties/obligations). "Izuzumbya" refers to ancestral spirits/obligations. "Jikamala jamilembu" implies those obligations have been fully completed (but perhaps not correctly or with negative consequences).

This is a difficult sentence with some potentially ambiguous phrasing, and regional variations in Kimbundu exist. However, here's a likely translation, aiming for natural English while preserving the original's intent: “My mother’s older sister, the one who sent me to the hospital with you, truly loves you, my child, and is very worried about you; she is constantly crying.” **Explanation of choices and difficulties:** * **"Ne mbe yama yavulu ya mukawutwatumgu"**: This translates to "My mother's older sister". "Yavulu" means older sibling (generally, but can be specifically older sister in context). "Mukawutwatumgu" is a respectful way to refer to someone who has agency or power in relation to the speaker, and in this case, likely someone who *sent* the speaker somewhere (hospital). * **"nayu mu jiphaliki jatwijidila kya"**: "Sent me to the hospital with you." "Jiphaliki" is the Kimbundu word for hospital. "jatwijidila kya" implies being sent *with* someone. * **"maji phe mwenyu wa yangu wa yangu mwene"**: This is a very emphatic "truly loves you, my child". "Maji" emphasizes the truth or sincerity. "Mwenyu" means child, but used as a term of endearment. The repetition of "wa yangu" (of mine/my) intensifies the feeling. “Mwene” adds further emphasis. * **"watokala waluka"**: This means "is crying/is weeping." "Waluka" is the act of crying. "Watokala" indicates a continuous or ongoing state. **Important Note:** Kimbundu relies heavily on context and tone. A more precise translation might require knowing the situation in which this sentence was spoken.
