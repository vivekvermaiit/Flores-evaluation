He added, “We have 4-month-old mice that are now non-diabetic, having previously been diabetic.”
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and chair of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association, warned that the research is still in its early stages.
Like other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetics can be cured, as these findings have no relevance to people who already have type 1 diabetes.

This confirmed not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colours and three-dimensional arrangements.
Researchers say that this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on the upperparts with a pale or carotenoid-colored underparts.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but possessed other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a hatchling.
The researchers hinted that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show adult plumage and not down from a bird chick.
A car bomb that detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.
The governor's office reported that nineteen of those injured were police officers.
The police said they suspect a claimed Daesh (ISIL) militant of being responsible for the attack.
They found that the sun operated on the same basic principle as other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number is, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversal.

The Iranian study group presented their report at 12:00 GMT today.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any sequence of events will stop the sectarian war in Iraq, increasing violence, or a path towards chaos.
The report opens with a plea for an open debate and the formation of consensus in the USA regarding their policy towards the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost every single aspect of the current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile intervention and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbours.
The current senator, and Argentina's First Lady, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers away from Buenos Aires.
Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine theater, the same place she used to launch her campaign for the Senate as a member of the delegation from Buenos Aires province in 2005.
The debate was sparked by a dispute over the spending of funds for emergency aid and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, which some fiscally conservative figures humorously dubbed “Bush’s New Orleans deal.”
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort has been directed at the profits reconstruction contracts have given to those with connections within Washington.

Society’s frustration led to ongoing attempts to develop a policy regarding sexual content on the site, which hosts millions of media with open licenses.
The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been a result of tidal forces between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
In the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth that causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter influenced other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the particularly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "highly disturbing and alarming due to the high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with the virus in the hospital, and that at least two were healthcare workers at the hospital.
During a year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis remains low; 6,000 out of the total 330,000 people infected, at any time point in South Africa.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods, which would spread sediment in the river, would be stopped.
This sediment was necessary to create sand dunes and beaches that served as habitat for wildlife.
As a result, two fish species have become extinct, and two others are threatened with extinction, including pink salmon.
Even though the water level will only rise by a couple of feet after the flood, officials hope this will be enough to restore the eroded sand dunes downstream.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations between night and day suggest they are most likely holes.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large holes on Earth which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their candidate choice in an envelope.
After election officials verify the voter’s identity, the voter places the ballot envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting slip.
French law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the voting procedure and that no envelopes are added except those from carefully counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to monitor every single part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close observation and by following specific procedures.

Her first event was slalom, where she received a ‘did not finish’ in her first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her second race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting class with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner Claudia Loesch, from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seated group failed to finish their run, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Police Inspector General D K Arya said, “We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have found her laptop and mobile phone.”
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver in the car still sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the crumpled Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with killing his son in Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting referral and trial, but evidence from witnesses may be manipulated as images of her have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the court has considered the publication of the images potentially prejudicial.
Professor at the University of Dundee, Pamela Ferguson, said “journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos and similar images of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecution Service, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics that were covered, according to reports, include the future of the state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to such a presence for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control pilot project were to be thoroughly monitored by guards while the effect of the pilot project was assessed and monitored.
In partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to the acting director of Park Protection and Heritage at the National Park and Wildlife Service, the first four selected hunters for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new interim electoral council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-government protest that began in October.
The occasionally violent protest was triggered by the fact that no elections had been held, some dating back to 2011.
There have been reports of around 60 cases of iPods overheating, which has led to a total of six fires and four people experiencing minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating which the company called “non-serious”.
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
According to the crisis management agency on the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage was reported in the commonwealth.
The tsunami warning center for the Pacific, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, also said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, the children and the elderly, were released at an early stage, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators from the authorities had found the two “black boxes” with the plane’s audio recordings.
Other athletes also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong woman.”
Dustin “Golddust” Runnels commented that “Luna was as crazy as me…maybe even more…loves her and will miss her…hopefully she’s in a better place.”
From a poll of 1400 people before the 2010 federal election, it emerged that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who participated in the poll shared this view and wanted Queen Elizabeth to be Australia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of those asked believed that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but as a result of his complaints, questions have been raised about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery by using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Researchers hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his position as governor earlier this month and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run as a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the American air traffic control claims can allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport options have been put in place and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride are not available on site.
Fear of a lack of transport has hinted at the possibility that the matches will take place behind closed doors without the teams' supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species evolved after only two generations, even though it was previously believed this process took much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, the medium ground finch, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostis*.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into very thin forms.
It can be spun into thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called “illuminated manuscripts”.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H⁺ in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every single house, which was connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains from the sewage system have been found in the houses from the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were present together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal to reflect it back down, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
It takes a large rocket that is over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much simpler and faster opportunities for transport.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other modes of transport.
Beneath them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat a much more varied selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a specific job each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live together in large groups called prides.
Prides are formed of one to three adult male lions, together with as many as thirty lionesses and their cubs.
Lionesses are usually related to each other, and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave very similarly to a wolf pack or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a very flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, run long distances, and drag with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t as powerful as the lion’s, but more like a sentence of growling, bellowing words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They readily catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than these.
Researchers believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They have night vision that allows them to see very well at night, and also move very gracefully. Ocelots hunt by camouflaging themselves in their surroundings while stalking their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island making it difficult for them to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they came from.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, which means the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become a strong competitor than those they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has begun to adapt to their new environment, which causes them to become increasingly different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (in other words, exhaled air).
Plants make their own food from sunlight using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not have been able to survive.
Mosasaurus was a top predator in its time, so it feared nothing – except other mosasaurs.
The male’s long jaw was surrounded by more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and with an extra set in the palate. It was, in other words, no escape for those who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs. He may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that ended up in the water – even gigantic dinosaurs, such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex, were no match for him.
While most of their food would have been familiar to us, the Romans nevertheless had some unusual dishes for their feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting down, wealthy men preferred to have banquets together while reclining on their sides when eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that came to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
They, for example, didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which was considered their home.
People brought offerings to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the gods’ needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary that only priests had access to.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special refuge for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't particularly important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the farmyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
Even though he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Even though a quarter of the countries were ‘Scandinavian’, there were large differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is still not correct. Even though something is written on the back, there is no treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words “original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was early in its life rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was governed by the French Vichy regime. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the southern part of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of people of significant size who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and in a way also defines the size of the society.
City-states are the driving forces of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across multiple generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and just dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as proper civilizations.
Through the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to levy taxes, and as there was no executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its decrees.
It also did not have the authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The resolutions required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, are the second most successful football teams in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes Japan the 6th largest island in the world!
Due to the clusters/groups of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an “archipelago”.
The beginning of Taiwan goes all the way back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a transformation of the indigenous people’s grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
Before 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed, and the reconstruction process continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by the sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are similar to, or approximately the same as, this aspect ratio.
The much-criticized and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a sense of order in images.
It says that the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It possessed a comprehensive power that influenced everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s funds are there for precisely that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective when it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international laws, codified by several minor international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into the entire sea area and inflicted damage on even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most residents were pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the brutality and heartlessness of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the USA to take a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He came to the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China and each family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch which took place over 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying while fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There are many social and political effects linked to the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism and republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to prosper.
The same applies to the military, as ranking is now based on skills rather than class, as it had been before.
The French Revolution also inspired many others, from oppressed working classes in other countries, to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond his everyday life. He often used a cave known as “Hira” on the mountain “Noor” (light) for contemplation.
The mine itself, which survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decline.
The mine sits on top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
She's actually not easy to find at all, even if you know she exists. When you are inside the mine, you are completely isolated.
Nothing could be seen above but clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains surrounding [us]. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century before the common era, and is one of the many pyramid structures that were built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or “Giza necropolis” in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The “up-bend” mark looks like a V, and the “down-bend mark” looks like a dot or square is missing on the underside of it.
Up indicates that you should start at the top and push the book, and down indicates that you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the book) and pull the book.
An up-bow typically produces a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more definite.
Feel free to create your own markings, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of the carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who had been killed in Versailles, before the terrified queen.
The costs of war for American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the expenses, and bond interest fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
The super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the fundamental achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that enabled the formation of the order.
The period when these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept encompassing a broad range of ideas, from technological promotion or the technological imperative, to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has “effects” on society that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
One can, for example, say that the automobile will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is nevertheless not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads healthcare to develop new techniques for treating injured people.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place for the community, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices which were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this period that the transfer of the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, took place.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was people beginning to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practiced to produce enough food to only meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that utilizes saved seeds from the eco-region combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characterized by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Membership in a subculture often signals its affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, behaviour and argot.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called “wild” or feral. Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this relinquishment of children was due to the parents’ rejection of a child’s severe, intellectual, or physical disabilities.
Children with behavioral problems may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before being surrendered or running away from home.
Others have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some have been thought to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When fully raised by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviour (within physical limitations) almost identical to that of their caregiving animals, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructive design is not a teaching method, but rather a tool that supports individuals engaging in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and is intended to question, guide, and clarify procedures that might have been too challenging for the student to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We are looking at the child welfare ordinance as a safe haven for these children.
Our child welfare ordinance is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, and stable education, as well as reliable healthcare.
Foster homes were intended to cover all the needs that were lacking in the homes they were taken from.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet led to several dimensions regarding the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “ongoing relationships” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they researched audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, movements in the face that last a few milliseconds.
It is particularly claimed that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech," indicated how people unable to comprehend speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to judge musical phrasing correctly.
He even suggests that such skills for interpreting human behavior might be shared by domestic animals like dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two gene pools with each generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
Furthermore, it has serious consequences if one fails at this: growth stunting, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available panther resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only is animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) digestible, but they also provide a high number of proteins containing all the necessary amino acids.
Considering all of this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find that you reset the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known diuretics) before sleep, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantra, and visualization.
The center for Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the USA. At the end of the war, the opposing systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries not getting along.
With two years after the end of the war, the two former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was fought in earnest, by proxy forces, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along Romanian bridgeheads.
These plans were nevertheless rendered obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time hindering your enemy’s ability to move theirs.
One of the most recent and noteworthy examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain in addition to the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
People began keeping animals in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Tame goats were typically kept in herds that grazed on high pastures or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young people – a form of goatherds. These herding methods are still used today.
Railway tracks made of wood were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though these tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the wagons to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads that existed at the time.
Sleepers were relatively early introduced to hold the rails in place. But little by little, people realized that the rails became more effective if they had a bit of iron spiked onto them.
This thus became common, but the iron led to greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. Humans, that is to say Homo erectus (="upright man"), began to walk upright two million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright regularly.
Evidence of bipedal specialization has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being kinder to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future burdens to a certain extent.
This is in many cases the same as treating the symptoms. But if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and thereby solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind. And problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people.
After Congress adopted the declaration on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read the document to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 “Dunlap broadsides” we know still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and live today. We call them birds.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
Pretty much all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always easy to detect. The symptoms (for example, vomiting) can be so vague that it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pillbox or poisonous household chemicals left within reach.
Check the label to find out what first aid you should administer for the substance in question.
In a formal sense, entomologists use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This concept originates from long-standing knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both mites and bedbugs are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
In the USA, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, meaning the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to research, women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them, or best for the child, to raise a baby.
These parents can choose to give the baby up for adoption.
Upon adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as a guideline for most scientific research.
But not only this. Experimentation is also used. An experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view on everything related to science, including psychology, was the accepted one.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was torn away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-running oscillators that will continue with periods where they run in free cycles, even when there are no external signals present.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments where they labeled either the DNA in the phages with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the affected genetic material is, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people take their cars and leave small suburbs to commute to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth transport, everyone is in a way connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why does the transport system generate so many complaints, and why does it fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow as one cannot predict driver behaviour with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range. Traffic flows are therefore often somewhat stable and can be roughly represented mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the skies. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies, and they found food and mates more quickly.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This means they have more small places to choose from when they need to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
For many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed him, but many believed quite the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's not so strange, really, because it doesn't *feel* like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places 9.5 km wide.
Full 20 percent of all the water that flows out of all the world's rivers and into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The main course of the Amazon River is 6387 km long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Even though pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and the outstanding technical execution.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, as all of these are found in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These four elements were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Although he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. And of course, we also have the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that consist of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that many billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and used less frequently as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write messages on screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
We can just wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new pops up.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When one then splits the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart with little or no influence.
The surface of the moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
She is thinner under the shadows (the dark areas) and thicker under the light areas.
There may be more volcanoes on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we mature.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviours can emerge when leaders begin to lead colleagues they were previously on the same level with. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader who tries to remain “one of the guys/group”.
This type of leader struggles to make unpopular decisions, reprimand employees, conduct evaluations, delegate responsibility, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who transforms into someone unrecognizable, and who feels they must change everything the group has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, it is the leader who is responsible for both the ups and downs of the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as a point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They often manage more independently than conventional team members because their teams typically meet across varying time zones, which may not be met with understanding from local leadership.
The fact that the group is truly “invisible” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The “invisible group” is the leadership team to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why should an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization? One of the goals one will achieve by putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and innovation can flourish.
A result of this process with an organization collaborating to overcome an obstacle is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, the leadership must establish a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. The field of research is thereby narrowed and much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports the researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Even though "science fiction" evokes strong associations with artificial intelligence (AI), AI constitutes a very important part of data science when it comes to understanding mechanisms, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
An example of this can be control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-world problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and are built into several computer applications and video game applications.
Excursions are a large part of all teaching. It is quite often the case that a teacher would like to take students to places one cannot reach by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
Each year, for example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about a trip to the state's largest city. Each year they rebuild the website, but keep old versions online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students become better writers. Even though students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, it usually improves when they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also makes “students compelled to understand the world around them better.” The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn things outside of the traditional school day.
Correct use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the internet, students can define their positions in the context of others’ texts as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).”
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada where they speak two languages. Here you will also find a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to, among other things, the untapped and scenic Muskoka.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as what foreigners see as most typically Canadian.
Large areas further north have quite scattered settlements, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the USA than there are residents in Canada.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a unique continent when it comes to animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are linked to France, and known as luxury holiday destinations with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great impact on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 1400s when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the regions are bound together by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advised that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 9th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the city got the name Casablanca from Spanish merchants who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in Congo that lies far east towards the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially in the center, were covered in lava.
It is relatively safe in Goma, but if you are going to travel outside of Goma, you must investigate carefully to find out what the situation is in the North Kivu province with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
The town is also used as a base camp for those who want to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also the starting point for those who wish to experience one of the most affordable gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with the fact that it is relatively difficult to access, “Timbuktu” is often used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city with much poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the World Heritage list for sites in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sand.
It was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which aired on the PBS channel.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities in the rest of the country, as it is more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the Crocodile River forms the border to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with unique animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa, and it is regarded as the flagship of South African national parks (SANParks).
Similar to all South African national parks, the park has conservation fees and entrance fees.
It might also be wise to buy a Wild Card, which provides free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists see as the main purpose of their visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar chart revealed by the water in Victoria Harbour.
You get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and head to the Kowloon shoreline on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coastline.
This was the place the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial period of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world, and it extends 80 km inland into Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans is on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The part of the forest that lies in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not merely mangrove swamps. They encompass some of the last remaining stands of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², and approximately one-third is covered with water/wetland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife and plant reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses leave from the bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since these buses between districts are often full, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. At that time, the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important ethnic group who lived in what is now called Eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also relied on agriculture for their livelihood.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and payaguá were also found, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish started the colonization period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the distinctiveness and identity of the indigenous peoples.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas in December.
At other times of the year, you can see tournaments and matches on a smaller scale.
Contact the Argentine Polo Association to learn more about tournaments and where you can buy tickets to polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) which has a fixed exchange rate with the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted. Contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods are approved.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months temperatures of over +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold. Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "rainy" or "dry" seasons. It rains roughly the same amount throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park authorities ask you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, deer, moose, bears, and most large animals can attack.
Each year, many visitors are injured because they haven't kept a safe enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you must be aware that smells attract bears and other animals. You should therefore avoid bringing or making food that smells, and the campsite must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a special situation arose at the harbor, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave it.
All the ships sank, with the exception of one British sailing warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of the leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As a result of Auckland stretching between two harbours, there are many beaches there. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
Northern coastal beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie along the Pacific Ocean, and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming conditions, and most also have shade from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are occasionally crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The local beer is called “Number One” and isn’t a complex beer, but good and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines would likely be a better choice.
Water from the tap is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is readily available if you want to be on the safe side.
A “flat white” would be foreign to an Australian. A small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with lots of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate often meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but good.
Many tours are arranged to the reef throughout the year, and it is rare for damage to the reef to occur as a result of this.
It is still wise to follow the advice of the authorities and obey all signs and warnings.
You can find box jellyfish near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the small town of 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean. Their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be sure they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, for example at a campsite, through a travel agency.
The travel agency usually offers package tours that include breakfast and transport to and from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to hold the reservation if you need time to consider the offer or arrange other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most attendees feel this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what's happening, you must come early to get a camping spot near the music.
Even though the music on the main stage has ended, there might be other places at the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with small children.
If you're going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check where your cabin is located. Some will hear it extra clearly when the vessel passes through the ice – it makes a lot of noise.
A cruise to Saint Petersburg gives you some time in the city. No visa is required for cruise passengers (check the conditions).
Casinos do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and money there as possible. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find your way out.
There are often special prices on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and encourage them to stay.
In some places, free alcoholic drinks are offered, but intoxication, as everyone knows, impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at higher latitudes or across mountain passes must be aware that they may encounter snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be reduced due to snow falling or blowing onto the windshield, or when fog or ice forms on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snow-covered conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In popular usage, the concept of safari refers to overland journeys to view the magnificent African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk near cars, and standard equipment will provide a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes a little shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") involves hikes that can last for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout various parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as they also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, it could be difficult.
The cancellation rules vary, but from the end of March, most cancellation rules based on the coronavirus no longer applied until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2500 JPY and 130,000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7000 JPY.
Damp clothes can become drier if you iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for loan, even though you don’t always find these in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can possibly try using a hairdryer.
Be careful so the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause it to shrink or, at worst, leave scorch marks).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, and if you don't feel completely safe, you can consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can damage food, be a nuisance, or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, do not normally qualify as pests.
With duty- and tax-free shopping, one can buy goods exempt from customs duties and taxes at specific locations.
Travellers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one often has to drive through desolate forest areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you must keep a cool head when you encounter steep inclines, narrow road surfaces, and sharp bends, which are typical of this stretch of road.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on earlier and later stretches of road, typically 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph), and it is even more important than usual to follow them.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than on many other stretches along the route, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rather rich and varied, much like with their southern neighbor, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples being added to baked goods year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A cup of strong coffee often goes well with such popular cakes.
If you want a small but powerful pastry, you can try what, depending on the region you are in, is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry dishes are based on herbs and spices mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In South India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a range of regional dishes found throughout the country.
But if one uses the term without further specification, the concept generally refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and offers a range of simply spiced dishes. The most dominant flavors that Javanese people prefer are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups provide support for the rider's feet, which hang down on each side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety hazard, because the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse bolts. A range of safety measures can help minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders use riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, also have a safety mechanism that allows a stirrup to detach from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is falling off.
Cochamó Valley – the leading climbing destination in Chile, known as Yosemite in South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a fantastic view. Climbers from many parts of the world continuously establish new routes in the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing, which includes skis and snowboards, are popular sports where one slides down snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Ski touring is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as “ski bums,” who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea behind skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers have been dated back to 5000 BC!
Skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring/backpacking: This is also called wilderness ski trips, cross-country ski trips, or mountain ski trips.
The activity is related to, but does not usually involve, ski touring in the high mountains or peak tours in steep terrain, which require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail you're going to traverse as if it were a long walk.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than if you walk, but it is only very rarely as fast as cross-country skiing on prepared trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Usually, when travelling through several countries, one must go through visa applications and passport controls multiple times.
But the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this context.
As long as you remain in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport controls.
If you have a Schengen visa, it works the same way. You do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, and thus you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America compared to Europe.
One can define handicrafts as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the activity is also important to many with other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sámi have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and they have mostly used reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, i.e. Sami land.
Even though it is widely used, especially by those other than the Romani people, the word "sigøynar" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.
If travel advice has been issued for the country you are visiting, this may affect your health insurance or cancellation insurance.
It can also be wise to check what advice is available from authorities other than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their residents.
American citizens in the Middle East, for example, may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often concise, general, and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can lead to damage, serious societal consequences, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme precipitation, and wildfires are forms of and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include heavy blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travellers should also stay informed about the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this can impact travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
With a search on the Internet for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course", you will likely find the address of a local company.
A course usually covers the situations discussed here in more detail, and typically with practical exercises.
A course typically lasts 2–5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about how to survive in the wilderness, but few publications about war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender-affirming surgeries abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
It varies how willing the authorities are to issue passports without a stated gender (X) or documentation that is updated to match the desired name and gender.
In addition, it varies how willing authorities abroad are to accept these documents.
Security checks have also become far more intrusive since the time after September 11, 2001.
Before the operation, transgender people can likely not expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outflow currents are currents of water from waves that have broken against the shore, and which are retreating, often near reefs and similar formations.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, and here a fast current can form outwards towards deeper water.
Most die from exhaustion while trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, it’s no harder to swim back than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won’t be caught by the current again. Alternatively, depending on what you can manage, and if anyone has spotted you, it might be wise to wait for someone to rescue you.
Reverse culture shock can come on faster than culture shock (fewer “flatbread days”), and it can last longer and be more intense.
Those who have been travelling and have found it easy to adapt to new cultures may find it particularly difficult when they have to readjust to their own culture again.
When they return home after living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits they had before.
When they travelled abroad, people were likely patient and welcoming at first, as it takes some time for visitors to adjust to a new country.
Everyone might not be equally patient and accommodating when the travelers return home, but this is just as important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in the quiet before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations. They have the most stations, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The island group lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km long mountain range in the shape of the Ellsworth Mountains, where the Minnesota Glacier cuts through.
The northern part, Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which has a peak rising 4,892 meters above sea level.
In remote locations where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a good substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used within shipping, including recreational vessels, and during expeditions that require external data and voice services.
The local provider of telephone services should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among school students who have completed a course of study and can take a gap year before they start university, without it affecting their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during a gap year can give you better chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Typically, one must pay a tuition fee to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful boating destination. “The land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, the figure in the Netherlands is one to forty).
Most common cruises in the Baltic region include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two whole days, but you return and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore when participating in excursions arranged as part of the tour, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
It can be scary to travel by plane for people of all ages and with different backgrounds, especially if they haven’t flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
There's no need to be ashamed. It’s not so different from fear and aversion to other things, as very many people experience.
For some, understanding more about how planes work, and what happens during a flight, can help overcome a fear based on the unknown or on a lack of control.
Delivery companies get well paid for delivering things quickly. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms, this was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it could on some routes have taken several days with unloading and customs clearance.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send those with checked baggage. The airline’s regulations don’t allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
It’s just a matter of coughing up a wad of cash (or better yet, getting your company to do it for you) if you want to fly first or business class.
This isn't cheap, and as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times more than a regular economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for cheap tickets to business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there is a specific group of air passengers who are willing to pay a lot for being able to travel somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic where there have been many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-declared Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency. However, it is not recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic cooperation has been resumed between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million. The city has the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transportation hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial city center surrounding a large bay and encircled by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings and modern shopping centres have traditional red roof tiles, a square from the 1700s and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere of the city is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the island of Eysturoy, which lies nearby, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, one can see interesting marble sculptures of doves above some tombstones.
It’s worth taking a stroll around the captivating village for about half an hour.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra. The town became known to foreigners when Lord Byron so eloquently conveyed how magnificent it was here.
Scotturb bus no. 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you can visit the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), where Mary revealed herself several times, stories that are known throughout the world.
Imagine you are simply visiting a mass grave and a place that means infinite much to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who survived that time, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked themselves to death here, both Jews and others.
The city deserves to be shown dignity, reverence, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by drawing or writing on the buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs are still only in Catalan, because according to the law, it is the official first language.
But Spanish is also widely used in connection with public transport and other services.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, while unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it is often a misunderstood stereotype, you’ll get by best in Paris by behaving as well as possible, like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). It will then be much easier to get around.
An apparently brusque exterior quickly disappears with Parisians if you are fundamentally polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park contains a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce and coniferous trees, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
He has a particularly wide range of plant communities due to the spectrum of microclimates, varied soil types, and changing altitudes.
In the area, one also finds an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
Here one can find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and black grouse, together with many more common species.
Women visiting the monastery must wear skirts that cover the knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend out shawls to women who haven't thought to bring one. But if you bring your own, especially one with light colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
This is also possible to borrow from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable wearing them. The sizes fit all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like in similar areas of the Mediterranean, uses a lot of bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) in addition to olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli. This is bread with olive oil, tomato, and available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the word Sie (You formal), always begin with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
In that way, one can more easily distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, even though writing is somewhat complicated because one has to figure out whether a verb or adjective is used as a noun.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as the pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also pay attention to pronouncing r and rr differently: Caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how you can understand sentences better.
If you know a Romance language, it will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But it’s easy for those who know a little Spanish to quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that one doesn’t need to study it separately.
Observatories built before modern times are largely outdated today and remain as museums or educational buildings.
Since light pollution wasn't a problem at the time, we usually find them in cities or on university campuses where they are more accessible than those built in modern times.
Today's modern research telescopes are often enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first celebrations of cherry blossom viewing were arranged by the emperor, and they were only for him and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so don't succumb to the temptation to "just take one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, “taking a souvenir” will certainly be grounds for being shown the door.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and it’s easy to get around. You can also get almost anything you need after you arrive.
But when you live in a tropical climate just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to cope with both heat (constantly) and strong sun (when it's cloudless, which is more rare).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you intend to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Waterways inland can be a nice basis for a vacation.
You can, for example, visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also the starting point for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide have adopted many of the traditions of the holiday.
It is a tradition to stay awake on Easter night and watch the sunrise outdoors.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as easily be a spring and fertility ritual with roots dating back to pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, where the congregation often breaks into celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally came to the islands arrived by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to complete the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since people arrived in the Galapagos, several mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Then there are good conditions for being able to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the population is spread out across the areas and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to see the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than people from the West are used to.
Dress is standard business attire, and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on team effort rather than praise of individual achievements.
Employees often need approval from their superiors for all decisions to be made, and they are expected to follow instructions from their superiors without questioning them.
