One of the antibody cocktails, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the lab, but formal studies revealed that it brought less benefit in preventing death than expected.
In the search for PALM, ZMapp served as a control, which meant that researchers used it as a reference point and compared it with three further therapies.
USA Gymnastics signed the letter from the Olympic Committee of the United States and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
Let's agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better supported by continuing with fair changes within our organization, and not by revoking licenses.
USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse, as described in such detail by the survivors of Larry Nassar, was able to remain undetected for so long and support all feasible and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal – to make the sport of gymnastics and others as safe as possible for athletes, so they can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers – a theory already widely disseminated – but shows details that fossils usually can’t, such as colour and a three-dimensional structure.
I firmly believe that the plumage of this animal was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid color underneath.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because feathers from dinosaurs don’t have a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – radiating – researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later stage of evolution than those other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample showed feathers of a mature creature, not down from a hatchling.
Researchers have suggested that, although it is a feather from a young dinosaur, the sample shows major plumage and not down from a chick.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon creates gravitational pull on Earth and causes ocean tides, so the Milky Way creates pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Researchers have come to the conclusion that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory states that most of the dark matter around galaxies is in a halo and consists of many small particles.

Schneider testified via video conference from the USAF base in his homeland.
Besides Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual competitions at the Championships.
First was the slalom, in which she received a Did Not Finish mark in the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in these competitions.
In the second run, the giant slalom, she finished tenth among seated women with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in a group did not finish their runs, and 45 out of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not finish the race.
Police from Madhya Pradesh recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya stated: "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
We, the Ôbskarżyni, are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki rushed over, as the accused showed up in court with covered mouths.
Although three people were in the house when a car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed, and rescue services have freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been held in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering his son.
She is in disgrace and awaiting the indictment and trial, but all the evidence from eyewitnesses may not be credible, because her image was widely publicized.
It’s common practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and courts view the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that “newspapers seem to be walking a thin line when they publish photos of suspects, etc.”
The Crown Office, generally responsible for prosecution, signaled to the media that there would be no further comments until an indictment is filed.
The document, according to a leak, will relate to a conflict over borders which Palestine wants to establish based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle Eastern war.
Other discussed topics reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Autonomy agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The shooters who participated in the extra pest control test were to be closely supervised by watchmen, because the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through the cooperation of NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, who fulfills the duties of Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive instructions regarding safety and training.
Martelly appointed a new Temporary Election Council (CEP) yesterday, which is composed of nine members.
They spent five million CEP on Martelly’s project over four years. (Note: "CEP" likely refers to a currency or unit of measurement specific to the context, and has been translated as "million" for clarity, assuming it’s a monetary value. "Piōnty" means five million.)
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the first CEO as part of a package of measures aimed at bringing the country closer to a new stage/era.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Sometimes spontaneous protests were triggered by the lack of dates for elections that were supposed to take place from 2011 onwards.
Over 60 cases of iPods overheating incorrectly have been reported, which resulted in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has reported what it knew about 27 incidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded to the belated report by Apple with "genuine regret."
The earthquake in Trzyniec began on Marian Hill at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The crisis management team of Northern Marianów stated that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Center warned about a tsunami, but also said that nothing indicated a tsunami.
Former Filipino police officers held Hong Kong tourists hostage after their bus was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several miners were rescued, and so far only six have been confirmed dead.
Six participants, including children and seniors, were released early, accompanied by Filipino photographers.
Photographers quickly took the place of the elderly woman, because she needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the lazaretto, in his free time, Liggins began to study premature births.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates the ripening of onions from seed.
Xinhua reported that investigators for the government recovered two flight recorders, that is, "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Wrestling buddies also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Truly exceptional, like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna was just as crazy as me… maybe even more so… he loved her and would pine for her forever… I hope she’s in a better place.”
Among 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those who oppose transforming Australia into a republic increased by 8 percent from 2008.
Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard affirmed during the 2010 election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, desiring that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
On opposite sides of the issue, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, and 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his form was in question.
He was unable to take the medications needed to overcome the pain, because they are banned at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
A team of people verified the discovery using a different sprint and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic material, which may form proteins and help sustain life.
It gave rise to hope for peace, as planets formed, especially Earth, considering comets crashed into Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, assumed the position of governor at the beginning of this year and signed into law last month a legal act legalizing same-sex marriage.
They relate to councils as to a "political babble and foolishness".
I'm thinking about running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system which, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
We need technology based on satellites, in contrast to older technology based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate flights and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no extra transport, trams don’t stop at Wembley, and surface parking lots and park-and-rides are inaccessible.
Concerns about a lack of transport sparked the possibility that the gig would take place behind closed doors, without the band's fans.
The research results published on Thursday in the journal Science report the discovery of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations, due to breeding between the native Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*, although it was previously thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold is going to be processed into various shapes. It can be twisted into delicate forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and folded. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be very thin and can be applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's dark. pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using juice from red cabbage.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on whether the given chemical compound is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the substance being chemically tested.
Ions of hydrogen are protons, which have been deprived of electrons (because atoms of hydrogen consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
Moisture in the markets will react with external workshops, creating a pleasant feeling and forming something like a shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had, in nearly every house, flushing toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the homes of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women stayed in mixed company.
When you call someone a thousand miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the connection and reflects it back down to the dish, almost immediately.
A satellite was launched into space by a rocket. We make use of telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and view.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, a gigantic rocket over 100 feet tall is necessary.
The wheel changed the world in an extraordinary way. The most important thing the wheel did for us is that it gave us easier and more flexible transport.
Thanks to him, we have a train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Underneath them are more cats of moderate ferocity, who prey on moderately ferocious game, from rabbits to antelopes and gazelles.
Indeed, there is a power of small cats (including domestic cats) who eat significantly more small victims, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is a niche concept, an extra task that every cat performs, and which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in fierce groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three related breeding males, together with up to thirty females and young.
Female bears are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides function similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can manage to climb (though not very well), swim, jump incredibly far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers belong to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar doesn’t recall the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather sounds like a sentence composed of raspy, wrenched words.
Ocelots gladly eat small animals. When they can, they hunt monkeys, opossums, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
They carefully observe what ocelots like to hunt and find them (victims) by scent, sniffing the ground where those animals recently were.
I see very well in the dark thanks to night vision and move stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey without blending into the surroundings, and then without attacking the prey.
When a small group of living beings (small population) becomes completely separated from the main population, from which it originates (e.g., if it moves across a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a newly formed island, so that it cannot easily return), it is often in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, therefore a new population, to be a strong competitor, will need different skills or adaptations than those it needed previously.
The original population hasn't changed at all, but still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to the new environment, it began to increasingly forget the other population.
Eventually, after thousands, or even millions of years, the two populations would look so different that it wouldn't be possible to speak of them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants obtain nourishment from sunlight through the process of photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
From plants we build our houses and from plants we sew clothes. Most of the wood we use comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The moose was the best predator of its time, it wasn't afraid of anything, except other moose.
His large jaws were equipped with more than 70 teeth sharp as razors, as well as extra sets of teeth on the upper jaw, which meant there was no chance of escape for anything that got in his way.
We don’t know for sure, but it might have had a tongue in the shape of a fork. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it might also have been a cannibal.
He’d attack everything that went into the water; not even a huge dinosaur like a T. rex could cope with him.
At a time when most people ate what was commonly known, the Romans during feasts also ate strange and unusual things, including wild boar, thrushes, snails and a sort of rodent called the jerboa.
The main difference was what poor people (including women) ate – their meals seated on stools – while wealthy men liked to have communal banquets where they reclined on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman spruce trees could not have contained products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a main temple, which was considered to be a home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs without ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple square, as well as an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Long ago, extra towers in the shape of pyramids were built, called ziggurats, to be part of temples.
On the top of the hill by the tower, there was an excellent sanctuary to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a home wasn't so important.
Most of the family’s life took place outdoors.
Women were standing in the square, the shops were just open signs facing the street. Stone was used for building the houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no harsh forests, therefore wood was extraordinarily expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, we read that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Even if every country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between people, kings, customs and history from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film "The Treasure of Nations," you might wonder what was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence regarding the treasure map.
However, that’s not true. Although there’s something written on the back of the document, it’s not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence was written "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." This text is on the underside of the document, upside down.
It is not known for certain who wrote it, but it is known that at the beginning of its existence this severe parchment document (measuring approximately 29 ¾ inches by 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that this inscription was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
They were rescued by Frenchmen from the Vichy regime. These were Frenchmen who concluded peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, the attack was named Operation "Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and headed towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together – a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," and this also in a way defined the maturity of a society.
City-states are precursors to nations. Civilization's culture entailed the transmission of knowledge across generations, maintaining a cultural pathway and its significant development.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War for Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with the Congress as its only element – according to the Statute of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose duties, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, the Congress relied on state authorities, which were often unwilling to cooperate and enforce all of its acts.
He also didn't have the authority to repeal excise laws and customs tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all estates, could sometimes be altered, and the estates treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most titled team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international games and Olympic events.
Japan possesses over 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because Japan possesses a group of islands, it is often described, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan reach back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as "Ilha Formosa," which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating changes in the local practices of textile production and also employing Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which administered the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of how these buildings looked before.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this renovation continues to this day.
For example, the most widespread format for still photography in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but importantly, its proportions match the formats of image converters from digital cameras.
The 35mm format is, to be honest, a little misleading – it’s actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The ratio of this format (without division by twelve, to get a simple ratio of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many popular formats (for example, the APS family of formats) have an aspect ratio that is equal to or very close to this ratio.
The often-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple advisor, whose application creates dynamics while maintaining order in the composition.
According to him, the most effective place for the main subject of the composition is the point where the lines dividing the picture into thirds vertically and horizontally intersect (both examples).
Without that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, also became an object of interest.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European countries despite differences in languages and customs.
This penetrating power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main rules of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and what money the church has is specifically designated for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was observed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supply lines, although the search violated generally accepted international law codified in numerous international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from influencing the entire ocean area, which posed a threat even to neutral ships.
Because the reaction to this tactic was limited, the Germans expected a similar reaction to unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a stance of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among the majority of citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelties of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the USA to Thomas Edison with about four cents in his pocket, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his first job).
Ancient China had an unusual way of showing different periods; each period or each family that was in power were separate dynasties.
Between periods of dynasties, there were also unstable epochs of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Era of Three Kingdoms, lasting 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those periods, fierce wars raged between powerful lords fighting for the throne.
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China; thousands of people perished without fighting to secure the highest position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There is a strong force of social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that a country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, professions were open to all candidates regardless of gender, which allowed the most ambitious and accomplished to achieve success today.
The same applies to the army, because instead of military ranks based on class, they are now based on capability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed representatives of the working class in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were beyond earthly life. He often visited a cave, which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light), in order to contemplate.
This cave, which has survived to our times, provides a very vivid image of spiritual inclinations from Muhammad.
It is located on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it’s not easy to find, even if you know of its existence. The interior of the cave is completely isolated.
You can’t see anything beyond the clear, beautiful sky above us and the power of the mountains all around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that has survived to this day.
Built without Egyptians in the third century before our era, the Great Pyramid is one of the mighty pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and a great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and the majority of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and family members.
The “violin bow up” sign looks like the letter V, and the “violin bow in a dish” sign looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom side.
At the top it indicates what you should start with – from the end and pull the bow, and at the bottom it indicates that you should start from the frog (from the place where your finger holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow held higher usually produces a softer sound, while a bow held lower produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings, but remember that the printed musical symbols are there for the music, and therefore should usually be respected.
The deposed King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), as well as the King’s sister, Elizabeth, were forced by a crowd of women from the market to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a dense crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats at the king and queen.
Then the people forced the king and queen to open wide the window of the carriage.
At a certain moment, one person from the crowd was waving a head from a display case belonging to the queen, a head reportedly of a royal guard killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were covered by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay tribute to the American colonial regime, in order to cover a larger share of expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Indeed, the substantial profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would have constituted the primary revenues of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the order’s creation.
The period in which these events took place was generally defined as the High Middle Ages, a period in the history of Europe that lasted in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and after it came the Late Middle Ages, which – according to convention – ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from those placing technology in first place, technologically imperative to the strict assumption that human destiny is driven by logic connected to the laws of science and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpreters of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development proceeds along a path independent of cultural or political influences, and that the effects of technology on societies are more inherent than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the existence of cars leads to the development of roads.
However, state-owned railways aren't economically viable for only a few cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increased occurrence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques for treating damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, exemplified by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and customs and culture developed alongside it; and these, because they were in accordance with their place in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As a result, Paris was known as the capital of the modern world, and Constantinople as the capital of feudal Europe’s fashion.
His renown as a center of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its importance diminished after the fourteenth century, mainly due to the fact that the Teutonic Knights returned from expeditions with goods such as silk and furs, which were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
This was a moment in which the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The peak of popularity of the Gothic style fell between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
Initially, the style of cladding was under strong Byzantine cultural influence from the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles from the West could be outdated by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant achievements of this time, which arose as a result of the Crusades, was buttoning clothes with buttons.
Subsistence farming, for one's own needs, is farming aimed at producing just enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses saved seeds native to a given ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other fairly simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and thus contributed to the strength of developing countries.
Subcultures gather similarly thinking individuals who feel overlooked by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnic origin, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
Subcultures, which I define separately, can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and vocabulary.
One of the most frequent methods of illustrating the consequences of socialization is referring to numerous unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, abuse, or intentional maltreatment, were not properly socialized during their formative years.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were abandoned by people (usually their own fathers); in some cases, this abandonment of a child was linked to the abandonment, by fathers, of a child with severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Homeless children may have experienced serious abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned by their fathers or running away from home.
Long ago, the forests sheltered wildlife; some say they lived entirely in the wilderness.
In the case of complete upbringing without animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the animal that cared for them, such as their fear of people or indifference towards them.
During times when teaching through project-based methods should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding isn’t done *by* a method, but rather with assistance, which provides support to people who are going through new educational experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding could be both virtual and real; otherwise put, a header is a form of scaffolding, just like a small clip-spinner in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and is intended to answer questions, advise, and clarify procedures that might be too difficult for a trainee to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, from neglect and abuse to extreme hardship.
No child should grow up in an environment that lacks care, tenderness, and education, but that’s how it happens.
We see a system of flight replacement for a safety zone for those children. (A more natural English phrasing, depending on context, could be: "We're implementing a flight rerouting system to create a safety zone for those children.")
Our flight system can provide safe homes, caring guardians, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster families can provide all the necessary things that were missing from the home from which the child was previously taken.
The internet consists of elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinctive features of the internet lead to extra dimensions in the approach to use and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “long-term relationship” were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they researched recipients’ reactions to online advertisements.
The application of video recording led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microexpressions, movements lasting for a few milliseconds.
Interestingly enough, it happens that after a thorough interpretation of microexpressions, one can detect if a given person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech due to a malfunctioning brain are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation is primarily a new genetic variation, and selection preserves it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination reverse variations back and forth between two pools with each generation.
On the savanna, it's difficult for a chief cicada to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources, with a digestive system like a human’s.
Moreover, neglecting this can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, and often remain largely undigested.
Surprisingly for them, forest animals (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the necessary amino acids.
Therefore, we should take everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in the same way chimpanzees do today on the savannah.
Interrupted sleep is a process of cyclical waking during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep from time to time shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
It’s easy to do using a relatively quiet device that will bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you happen to switch off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or juice, known diuretics) before sleep, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
The lower the voltage, the more positively life force flows. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was expanded with Mahayana doctrines and also with many techniques from Indian yoga.
In its basic principles, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened without yoga postures, through breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Yoga of the Gods. Without visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and gradually consciousness is illuminated.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Together with the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to a rift between these countries.
After two years from the end of the war, the wartime allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for another 40 years and be taken seriously, without substitute armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization in Romania.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army from the Soviet Union entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern regions of Poland, breaking the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is truly the most efficient way of moving huge quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the mission of the navy was to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time hindering the ability of your enemy to move their people and goods.
One of the most striking examples was the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, largely without using U-boats, tried to block this movement.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would probably have been in a position to conquer Great Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to flour, fur, meat, and hides.
House cattle were usually kept in herds, which wandered through meadows or other pastures, often overseen by cattle herders. These were often children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known shepherd of sheep. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Despite the fact that the wagon floors consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat more uneven roads of those times.
Early on, they installed grates to maintain the glass in place. Gradually, however, they realized that the glass would be more efficient if an iron layer were found on top of them.
It became a common practice, but iron caused a greater demand for wooden pegs for wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron frames were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, people began to walk in an upright position two million years ago along with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means 'upright man').
My predecessors, the australopithecines, didn't walk in the habitually upright position.
Bipedalism appears in fossils from australopithecines dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more consciously for the environment, we can join the ecological movement, and even become activists, in order to reduce future suffering to some extent.
According to the circumstances, it's simply a symptomatic manifestation. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the source of the problems and eliminate it.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have become more severe due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the officially engrossed document signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent by messenger further to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document took place on July 8th by John Nixon on Independence Hall square.
One exemplar was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which allowed him to read it to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 broadsides of Dunlap, as far as we know that still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten exemplar has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe today that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
There's a lot of things in birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
We have scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today rely on manipulating information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are defined as binary digits – or bits, as used in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indicator of indoor poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Find the label with specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "płoszczycowate" is used by entomologists as a formal designation for this group of insects.
This distinctive trait originates from an ancient kinship with bedbugs, which are insects well-adapted to parasitizing humans.
And bed bugs and fleas live in nests and are adapted to life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the entire United States of America, around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that only affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
Sometimes it may seem that raising a child is not in their best interest, nor in the interest of their child.
These times, I could choose a foster care plan for my child.
In adoption, biological fathers relinquish their parental rights so that another family can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific investigations.
It's not just about experimenting; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to answer questions and make observations, and also to conduct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and particularly on the Bible in Latin.
The views of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
Together with the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West severed itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillating oscillators, which continue the period of a free cycle even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, that is viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments without calibrating or using DNA from phage with radioactive phosphorus, or protein from phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Some mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interesting people to beloved natural areas for admiring landscapes, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on the square include running, kite flying, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
Greed and egoism will always be with us, and this is the nature of cooperation, that when the majority benefits, someone will always try to gain more in a short time, without functioning altruistically.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns in their cars to their workplaces, and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they almost left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now condemns that this mass economy ripped the biosphere from one of its stable states, which fostered human evolution over the last two million years.
We all participate in social life and use transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such a level of complaints about water quality or crumbling bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or could something more fundamental be happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual cyclists and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, predicting traffic flow is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range; because of this, traffic flows tend to have a certain reasonable coherence and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, dependencies were established between three main parameters: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These dependencies help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their talent for flying helped them more easily avoid enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have that advantage, that they can fold their wings to their rear along their body.
It gave them a wider range of small places where I could hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are grasshoppers and stick insects.
Long ago, a man named Aristarchus proposed that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some intellectuals believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite – that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is second in length and the largest river on Earth. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
From the Amazon comes 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans.
The main river Amazon has a length of 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza never equaled them in terms of size and technical perfection of construction.
Ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already counting roughly thousands of years then.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and a country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also a language actively used by the majority of people working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People knew about basic chemical elements – such as gold, silver, and copper – since antiquity, because all of them could be discovered in nature in native form and are quite simple to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, asserted that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were: earth, water, air, and fire.
It reminded one of the four states of aggregated matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances, creating what we see.
Alloys are truly mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Steel contains small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Without it, Blażej was a good friend to many people when he finished [his studies/school].
Unfortunately, along with the emergence of newer writing methods, the lead pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less frequent use.
People are writing messages now on computer screens, without the need to go near a pen/sharpener.
One just needs to think about what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works in such a way that energy is needed to combine nuclei from the power of protons and neutrons.
I remember pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splintering wood releases even more energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores, which means they have a tendency to decay with little or no prompting.
The Moon's surface was built from stone and dust. The outer layer of the Moon was called the crust.
The shell has a thickness of around 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is darker under the seas and rougher under the highlands.
On the near side, there might be more seas, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to emerge onto the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what resonates with people or speaks to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that were internalized during their development into adulthood.
We analyze these theories about what it is in certain people that makes them want to do things they do, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or girls).
This sort of manager has problems with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, evaluating work, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who has changed into an unrecognizable individual, who feels they must change everything the team did and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is finally responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and the rest of the team.
In virtual teams, the same standards of excellence apply as in conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often fulfill the function of a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have stronger autonomy than members of conventional teams, because their teams can meet at various times, which may be unclear to local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an unusual component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is a management team where each member is subordinate to it. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would the organization want to skip the time-consuming process of creating an educational organization? One of the goals of implementing the concept of an organizational learning process in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized by all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can flourish.
As a result, the process in which an organization works together to overcome a problem can lead to the creation of a new, innovative process that satisfies customer needs.
The organizational structure can be innovative; leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach, a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They expand this field of research and make it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and the behaviour of spirits was learned in their investigations.
It is well known that various types of brain damage, injuries, alterations and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allowed us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes in a way never seen before.
It provides a lot of information and materials for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes taking place in our environment.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research on AI encompasses the creation of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and creating schedules, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from clients, as well as recognizing handwriting, voice and creation.
These things have become separate disciplines, which concentrate on delivering solutions for real-life problems.
AI systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and have also been built into many home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. The headmaster often wants to take his students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while remaining in the classroom.
A virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the field trip and share experiences with future classes.
Without this example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their field trip to the state capital; each year the site is rebuilt, but older versions are preserved online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. When students often begin their experience with blogs with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author began to strive to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be more perceptive in relation to the world around them." The need to capture public attention inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is something that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The occasional need for blogs "may cause students to become more analytical and critical; without actively responding to online materials, students may discover their position in the context of texts by other people, as well as outline their own point of view on individual issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a beautiful, two-hour-away capital of Canada and possesses many art galleries and museums, which show Canada’s past and present.
To the south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and not only that.
All these things and much more emphasize that Ontario is considered the quintessence of Canada by people from outside.
Large areas located further north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are virtually uninhabited wildernesses.
Comparing the population was surprising: There are more African Americans living in the USA than citizens of Canada.
The East African Islands lie on the Indian Ocean off the eastern coasts of Africa.
Madagascar is incredibly far away and, when it comes to wild nature, it's practically a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which is strongly present on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influences and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Good Hope, a route leading from Europe to India.
In the north, this region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is required that every travelling woman state that she is married, regardless of her actual civil status.
Helpful are also small cushions (but not those that look too expensive).
Women need to be cautious, as cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and it often happens that they are followed, grabbed by the arms, etc.
Be firm in defending your values and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, they don't make something right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it to the ground after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places where primarily traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of gadgets, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered a large part of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all sources outside of Goma should be checked to understand the state of conflict prevailing in the North Kivu province.
This city is also a base for expeditions to the Nyiragongo volcano, together with one of the last mountain gorilla tracking locations in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its perceived inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although it has an airport, and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was listed on the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
He was one of the main presenters during PBS's special program "Wonderful World of the African Diaspora" hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts with the rest of the cities in the country, because it has more of an Arabic than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeastern part of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 diverse ecological areas, each with different fauna and flora every year.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, daily conservation fees and a park entry fee apply.
It might also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to selected parks in South Africa or to all national parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island bears the name of the Hong Kong territory and is a place that many tourists consider a major point of interest.
The parade of sailboats creating a panorama of Hong Kong was compared to a shimmering bar chart, visible thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
An overwhelming majority of the city’s island development in Hong Kong is densely spread across reclaimed terrains along the northern shore.
This is a place that British colonizers claimed as their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of the colonial past of this territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest single mangrove forest on Earth, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. A part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests aren't just maritime thickets, but also some of the last remnants of primeval jungles that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km², of which about one third is water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that around 400 royal Bengal tigers and over 30,000 spotted deer currently live within this area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since intercity buses are often full, it’s good to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Shared taxis are a flexible and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Poro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. Spanning the Oyapock River, it connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two viaducts reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes of traffic, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully ready for use in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian control points is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territories of present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was a home for other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of India," was born from the encounter of Spanish conquistadors with various indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve the strength of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The oldest tournament of the year took place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games also go to see at other times of the year.
To get information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is pegged at one to one with the British pound (GBP).
She's going to exchange money in the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are accepted in every establishment on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the peripheral islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; it is necessary to contact the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is immediately impossible, so you need to exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; temperatures above +30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct “rainy” and “dry” seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though the power of animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of people, they are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
Regardless of how docile they appear, bison, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors experience injuries, because they didn’t keep a safe distance. These animals are fierce, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Furthermore, remember that they attract bears and other wild animals, therefore avoid wearing or carrying strongly scented pines and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital city of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of slightly under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval conflict in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
There are many beaches because of the two ports in Auckland. They are most popular in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They have almost all sandy beaches with the possibility of safe swimming, and also provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
Most beaches are sandy, it's safe to swim everywhere, and most shadows are provided by tall pohutukawa trees.
Sometimes the beaches are crowded family beaches with a large selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
These are very nice, quiet family beaches with a good selection of shops by the seaside. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One", it's not a complicated beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There’s a lot of French wine, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
Local water from the tap is completely safe to drink, but it’s easy to get bottled water if someone is worried.
For Australians, the concept of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. Simply black is "espresso", cappuccino contains a terribly large amount of cream (not foam), and it’s all ground with a grinder.
Abel Tasman National Park is in the Nelson Bays region on the South Island of New Zealand, between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay.
Many excursions to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries resulting solely from these reasons on the reef are rare.
Despite this, one should listen to the advice of authorities, adapt to all signs, and pay attention to warnings concerning safety.
Jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of 1770. It happens rarely to find them outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
Estuarine crocodiles don’t live actively in the ocean; their main habitat is river mouths north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveler certainty that upon arriving at the destination, they will have somewhere to sleep.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may turn out that through a travel agency you can book other forms of accommodation, e.g. camping sites.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and even packages combining flights and hotels.
I can also hold a reservation for you, if you need time to consider the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be reported to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, a vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the festival grounds, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to leave early to get a spot at the campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have finished, there could be parts of the festival still playing until the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have extra Celtic areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, because traveling without ice causes terrible discomfort for the most sensitive people.
Trips to Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on these cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are deliberately absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have some extra amenities, snacks and entertainment offers to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them at the place.
Some local establishments offer alcoholic beverages at the company's expense. Intoxication impairs judgment, but all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone who intends to drive a car in severe geographical latitudes or across high mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the friction is low and it’s not possible to drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short time it can eat enough snow to get stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation of water vapor or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy roads are within the power of normal conditions, and road traffic usually proceeds without problems throughout the year.
Safari is probably the strongest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to a journey by land for viewing breathtaking African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, have a tendency to approach cars closely, and a standard alignment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes skittish and it’s better to watch them without binoculars.
Foot safaris (also known as "walks in the wilderness", "wandering safaris" or "foot hikes") allow for hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
People who booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the unexpected cancellation of the date may find themselves in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies are varied, but from the end of March most cancellation policies based on coronavirus no longer cover July 2020, on which the Olympics were planned.
It is predicted that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If the curling iron isn't available, or if you're wearing straightened hair, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Watch out that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause it to shrink, and in extreme cases, to catch fire).
There are various ways to thaw water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying water in a tightly sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests they don't recognise from their home regions.
Pests can damage fir trees, cause irritation, or in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread iodine deficiency, or transmit infections.
The same infectious or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods exempt from VAT and excise duty in specified locations.
Smugglers who try to bring goods into countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presented the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, often running through undeveloped forest terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, use common sense: expect steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp bends.
The imposed speed limits are noticeably lower than on the initial and subsequent sections – around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than in other cases.
Interestingly, the cellular phone signal is much better here than in many other parts of the trail, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those from its southern neighbour, Austria.
Popular are fruit baked goods, with apples baked into pastry all year round, and cherries and plums appearing in summer.
To enhance German pastries, almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts are also added. Popular cakes are often excellently paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you have a craving for small but rich pastries, try those, which depending on the region are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with added meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
Deep within the lands of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is merely an umbrella term encompassing a huge diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the entire country.
However, if used without further specification, this term usually refers to fir trees originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Here, there’s widespread access to everything across the entire archipelago, the cuisine quietly boasts a simplicity in preparing dishes, with peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices dominating among them.
Stirrups are supports for the feet from the rider, which are higher in the stirrup irons on both sides of the saddle.
We provide them with greater stability for skiers, but they can be dangerous due to the possibility of getting their feet caught in them.
If a rider is dismounted from a horse, but their foot remains caught in the stirrup, they may be dragged along if the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, it is advisable to take certain precautions.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a buckle and a smooth, quite wide, golden spur.
Subsequently, some saddles, particularly English ones, have safety straps that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if the rider is pulled backwards by the horse without falling off.
Cochamó Valley – a main climbing area in Chile, known as the ‘Yosemite of South America’, with a variety of large granite walls and towers.
From the peak, breathtaking views unfold. Climbers from all corners of the world meticulously seek out new routes amidst the boundless potential of the walls.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving gliding down a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main goals of trips, and a lot of enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums," plan entire holidays around skiing in some place.
The history of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as backcountry ski, ski touring, or ski hiking.
She is associated with alpine skiing or alpinism, but usually isn't involved in the latter, which takes place on steep terrain and requires much more robust skis and boots.
Think about ski touring as about a similar hiking trip.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly greater distances on horseback than when walking – but very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on prepared trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent, which is relatively small, but with a wealth of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through many countries would mean repeatedly going through visa procedures and passport control.
The Schengen Area, however, functions in that regard somewhat like a single country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without needing to repeatedly go through passport control points.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you don’t need to apply for a visa to each of the countries belonging to the Schengen area separately, which allows you to save time, money and the hassle of paperwork.
There isn't a universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some insurance companies define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
This definition is geographically varied; the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Niche market products can be considered antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important traditional livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture connected to this industry is also important to the well-being of people working in other professions.
However, even traditionally not all Sámi people were engaged in reindeer herding on a large scale, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, largely treating reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the region of the Sámi people.
Although it is commonly used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Cygōn" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you visit is subject to specific travel advice, it may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can also use the advice of authorities from other countries besides your own, but their advice is intended for citizens of those countries.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might find themselves in a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are a brief summary of the political situation in a given country.
The presented views are often superficial, general, and overly simplified in comparison to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather phenomena is a general term describing any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social disruptions, or fatalities.
Severe weather phenomena can occur in virtually any place in the world, and there are various types of them that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather phenomena, just like thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
It is important that travelers are aware of the risk of severe weather phenomena in their vicinity, as these could affect their travel plans.
Everyone who plans to stay in a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
Searching the internet for the phrase "Survival course in a hostile environment" will likely show addresses of local companies.
The course typically covers all discussed topics in a much more accurate way, usually with practical experience.
The training usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, basic first aid training, and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are rare.
Travellers, who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad, must check if they have valid return travel documents.
The willingness of registries to issue driver's licenses to people of unspecified gender (X) or to update documents to reflect a requested name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour those documents is just as varied.
In the period after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints became much more invasive.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to go through without scanners compromising their privacy and personal dignity.
Rip currents are returning currents from the waves, which move away from the shore, often onto a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates on sections of greater depth and there can quickly form a rapid current towards the deeper water.
Most drownings occur as a result of trying to swim against the current into a rapid, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the valley, flowing back won't be harder than usual.
Try to aim for a spot where you won’t get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve already been spotted by someone, aim for a spot where you can wait for reinforcements.
The shock of return comes harder than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), it's a big worry and can be heavier.
People who easily adapted to a new culture, often find it difficult to adapt to their own native culture.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some customs from your home culture.
When someone went abroad, people were very patient and understanding, because they knew that newcomers in a new country must adapt.
People couldn't have expected that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
Showing sounds and lights on the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
It's going to see the pyramids in the dark and it's going to see them in silence before the starting show. **(Or, more naturally):** We're going to see the pyramids at night and then see them in peace before the show begins.
From afar, you can only hear the clatter of tourists and vanguard troops. The history of clatter and light is like a book of fairytales.
The Sphinx is a shadow and narrator of a long tale.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and other pyramids are illuminated.
To the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, several countries lay claim and there are the most bases – sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest of them is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Otherwise, it's Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a flooded caldera through an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula connect here with the plain, and then reappear, forming a 360-kilometer chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut through by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose peak is Mount Vinson, 4892 m high.
In remote areas, without cellular phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a phone call.
The use is often required without navigation, including passenger ships and also expeditions that have remote needs during data and voice transmission.
The local provider of telephone services should be in a position to provide more information regarding connecting to this service.
Currently, the most popular option for people planning a gap year is travelling and learning.
It is particularly popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before starting their studies, without detriment to their education.
According to statistics, signing up for a gap year course abroad can significantly increase your chances of being accepted to higher education in your home country.
You have to pay school fees to register for these educational programs.
Finland is a great place to swim in the bays. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, on the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and on lakes you don't always need a yacht.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller ships and also kayaks offer a different experience.
Sauna bathing is a national pastime in Finland, with one sauna for every seven or eight people.
This aligns with the results of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands that number is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a longer stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city without wasting days, and at night return and sleep on the ship.
If you are travelling to land only using boarding passes, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
On some cruises, brochures show Berlin in Germany. As can be seen on the above card, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Experiencing turbulence can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of; it's no different from personal connections and inclinations towards other things that many people have.
For some, understanding the principles of how flight works and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or lack of control over the situation.
Courier services are well-paid for fast delivery of packages. Often time is very important in the case of business documents, goods, or replacement parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies had their own flags, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they shipped goods by air freight, on some routes transit without reloads and customs clearance could take several days.
The only way to get it past security was to check it as registered baggage. Airline regulations don’t allow baggage to be checked without a passenger, and that’s practically why you’re here.
An obvious way to fly in first or business class is to spend a hefty amount of money for that privilege (or even better, have your company pay for it).
But this isn't falling for fools: with a bit of peasant logic, you can expect to pay even four times more than the normal economic price for business class, and only twice as much for first class!
Generally, there's no point in or it’s not worth looking for discounts on business or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know very well that they’ve identified a strong group of travelers who are happy to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and in comfort, and they act accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers because of ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, that conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the lack of progress in political negotiations between these two parts of Moldova, economic contacts were nevertheless established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling trading center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.

Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, and onwards to Cabo da Roca.
In the north, there is the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place famous for Marian apparitions throughout the world.
Remember, please, that you will hate the site of a mass grave, and also the place that has immediately unrecognizable significance for a terrible lot of people in the world.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time in this place, and also many others whose loved ones were murdered or killed in this place, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with dignity, reverence, and respect, as it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust and the Nazis.
It is forbidden to damage property without tagging or painting graffiti on structures.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half prefer to speak Catalan, reportedly most understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs were provided only in Catalan, because it is recognised by law as the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only given in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are broadcast via an automatic system in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, unfriendly, and arrogant.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get around in Paris is to behave as best as possible like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). This will make getting around much easier.
Showy behaviour from Parisians will quickly disappear if you treat them with basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beeches, spruces and firs, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
My particularly strong diversity of plant communities results from the gliding of microclimates, diverse soils, and varied altitude levels.
This area is also a home for extraordinarily diverse species of animals and birds.
We are home to rare species of fauna, such as the brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie, as well as many other common species.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts covering the knees and have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provided headscarves for women who came unprepared, but if you bring your own hair covering, especially in light colors, you’ll receive a smile from a monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, boys are obligated to wear short trousers, which cover the knees.
You should borrow those from the storage by the entrance, but they certainly aren’t washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing those dresses. One size fits all!
The cuisine of Majorca, like in similar regions of the Mediterranean Sea, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used for its preparation.
A simple, popular lunch, especially during the summer, is *Pa amb Oli*: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available toppings, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, together with the word 'Sie' as you, fools, begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It is an important way to distinguish certain verbs from objects.
Certainly, understanding and using Polish loanwords will also improve reading, although writing is slightly more difficult due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronunciation is quite easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Capital letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel following them.
Remember also to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' denotes a road, while 'carro' denotes a chariot.
Persian has a fairly easy and largely regular grammar.
Without it, reading this grammatical syllabus will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
You don't need to add that if you know some Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can easily come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so close that it doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Early observatories are today usually outdated and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because destruction wasn't such a problem in the times of their glory, they are now usually located in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research reactors are enormous facilities located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the most cherished flower.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the blooming of cherry blossoms were organized not for the public, but for the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to cut down even "just one" specimen.
If you formally dislike the organized city, you will also be punished for collecting "specimens," no discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and it’s very easy to get around, and upon arrival you can buy almost everything.
However, when you're in the "high tropics"—just a few degrees north of the equator—you'll have to deal with both humidity (dampness) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is rare).
There are also buses running north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Find out if the bus you want to ride goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Waterways in Strzelce County could be a good basis for building a vacation around.
Without this, sightseeing of castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, a boat trip to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal are all options.
We also mark the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Much tradition connected with this saint was also accepted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians throughout the world.
It is traditional that during Easter, one spends the night in some exposed location in order to see the sunrise.
Well, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often organize Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin celebrating at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that arrived on the islands earlier, got here without swimming, without flying, or without floating on the water.
Because of the great distance from the continent, finches were unable to complete the journey, which is why the giant tortoise became the main animal that grazes on the Galapagos.
Since people arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It's good to be prepared to see the northern lights, because the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Because these areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what people from the West are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or by nickname.
Key is harmony in the workplace, which emphasizes teamwork more than celebrating individual achievements.
Employees often have to get approval from their superiors for all decisions made independently, and unconditional obedience to superiors' orders is expected of them.
