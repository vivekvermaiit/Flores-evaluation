Sapmi is the Sami homeland. * **kɛ lɔ̱äŋ kɛnɛ ŋääri̱ ti gööl no̱o̱ŋɛ ji̱ Sami yio̱w:** This is the most complex part. It translates to roughly "with good wishes for their journey and remembering the Sami's words/stories/songs". *lɔ̱äŋ* implies good wishes/a good journey. *ŋääri̱* refers to things said, stories, or songs. *yio̱w* emphasizes the Sami people as the source of those stories/songs. I’ve phrased it as “remembering the stories and songs” to capture the essence.
