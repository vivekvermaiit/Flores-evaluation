This is a difficult sentence, rich in cultural context and nuanced phrasing.

The negative *ka* indicates displeasure. * **"lika ocisimilõ caliwaya voluila cokuti ovinyama vinene vyokosimb"**: This is a very descriptive phrase detailing the cattle. Breaking it down: *ocisimilõ* (ancestral spirits – often connected to cattle), *caliwaya* (cattle), *voluila* (their), *cokuti* (horns), *ovinyama vinene* (great black – describing the cattle’s colour and importance), *vyokosimb* (broken/damaged). * **"via kala lovolu"**: "their hides are scarred". *kala* means skin/hide, *lovolu* means scarred/damaged. * **"cecavo uvangi weci ovilimbu vikalo wovinyama viaco ka vitelã"**: "therefore, let those who commit such acts be afflicted with sores and illnesses". *Cecavo* (therefore), *uvangi* (those who do/commit), *ovilimbu vikalo* (sores and illnesses), *viaco ka vitelã* (afflicted with/struck by). * **"ndeci evala kuanda ocindekase ndomo ovio via kala"**: “so that they may understand the consequences of their actions.” *Ndeci* (so that), *evala* (they understand), *kuanda* (consequences), *ocindekase* (their actions), *ndomo ovio* (the matter of/regarding) *via kala* (their actions - repeated for emphasis). It’s important to note that Umbundu often relies on context and indirect phrasing, making a direct, word-for-word translation impossible while maintaining natural English. This translation aims to capture the *meaning* and *cultural weight* of the original sentence.

This is a complex request as the sentence appears to be a mix of Umbundu and what seems to be transliterated Hindi/related languages. Here's the best possible translation, acknowledging the blended nature of the text: "Yesterday, Sanju Sharma Wafetica finished building, and this is Shankar Choudhar. He presented the fifty-six devotional songs for this purpose. Yesterday, Raju Khandelwal got stuck/faced a problem." **Important Notes:** * **"chhappan bhajan"**: This is Hindi for "fifty-six devotional songs." I've directly translated it. * **"leye"**: This appears to be a Hindi/Urdu word meaning "for the purpose of" or "for this." * **"ukwama vo"**: "Ukwama" in Umbundu means "to get stuck," "to face a problem," or "to be in difficulty." "Vo" doesn't directly translate from Umbundu and likely is carried over from the other language present, reinforcing the meaning of encountering an issue. * **Mixed Language:** The presence of Hindi/related terms strongly suggests this was spoken or written in a context where both languages were in use. A purely Umbundu sentence would not contain these elements.

Umbundu, like many Bantu languages, relies heavily on imagery and indirect speech. The "small bird" is a metaphor for someone facing adversity. * **"Owiñgi" (Bird):** Repeated use emphasizes the core metaphor. * **"Omwenyo" (Strength/Ability):** Not just physical strength, but also determination and resilience. * **"Vatunda" (People/Persons):** Refers to people in general. * **"Cilomboloka" (Perseverance/Endurance):** Crucial to understanding the message. * **"Olonjanja vyalwa" (those with a common goal):** This emphasizes unity and collaboration. * **"Vyosimbu vyakalele-ko" (wisdom of ancestors):** Umbundu culture places high value on ancestral wisdom.

This is a difficult sentence with nuanced cultural context! Here's the most accurate translation, aiming for both literal meaning and conveying the implied meaning: "Sometimes, when things aren't going well with my family (even when things seem hopeless and there’s trouble with finances), I remember my ancestors – their wisdom guides me (they say, if you persevere, eventually things will improve)." **Explanation of choices and difficulties:** * **"Oku endela vo mbalaum"**: This translates to "sometimes when things aren't going well," or "when difficulties arise." "Mbalaum" carries a sense of hardship and not just any problem. * **"kolomangu viatete ale kolomangu viavelapo"**: This is complex. It literally means "with my family, even when it's bad, and with my family when it’s finished/ended." But the intent is to convey a situation where family life is deeply troubled, possibly feeling like it’s falling apart, or is at its worst. "Viatete" implies a very bad state, and "viavelapo" can suggest things are nearing a breaking point. * **"okweca olombongo vyalwa"**: This translates to "remember my ancestors." "Olombongo" specifically refers to ancestors and ancestral spirits. "Vyalwa" adds a sense of reverence and connection. * **"(ale, okuyula okuti, onjo yupange wove icilinga)"**: This is a proverb or saying. It translates roughly to "(and, they say, if you persevere, eventually things will improve/become clear)." "Icilinga" implies clarity or a better future. “Onjo yupange” translates to ‘it will be well’ or ‘things will improve’. It's important to note that Umbundu, like many African languages, often relies on context and proverbs to convey deeper meaning. This translation attempts to capture that nuance as well as possible.
