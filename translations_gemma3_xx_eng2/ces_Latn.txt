Although one experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing Ebola mortality, the suitability of any drugs to treat an existing infection has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially looked promising, but formal studies suggested it had less benefit in preventing death than hoped for.
In the PALM test, the product ZMapp served as a control treatment. In other words, scientists used it as a baseline for comparison with three other types of treatment.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter to the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee that the interests of our athletes, their clubs, and the sports themselves will be better protected if we support meaningful changes within our organization, rather than if the organization loses official authority.

This finding not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory that is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as information about color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that this animal’s plumage was chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the issue of feather development in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed central shaft, called a rachis, but possess other characteristics – rays and barbules – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used during flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Scientists hypothesize that even though it’s a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not those of a hatchling.
Scientists hypothesize that even if it is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample represents the plumage of an adult animal and not downy feathers of a juvenile.
A bomb in a vehicle that exploded near the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 other people.

They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is evidently determined by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
Based on luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of a star is determined, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active a star is in terms of magnetic overturning.

The Iraqi study group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
It warns of the inability to guarantee that any targeted activity in present-day Iraq will stop sectarian fighting, escalating violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report begins with a call for an open debate and the creation of consensus in the United States regarding policy towards the Middle East.
The report is largely critical of nearly all aspects of the executive branch’s current approach to Iraq and calls for an immediate change of course.
The first of his 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be undertaken before the end of this year to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile interventions and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

Community outrage has led to current efforts to prepare rules regarding sexual content for a website containing millions of openly licensed media.
The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team searched for a phenomenon caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of "halo" and consists of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In the interview, he stated that the new variant is “highly concerning, even alarming, due to its high virulence.”
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have caught this virus in the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital healthcare workers.
During one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB within the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears low – 6,000 people out of a total of 330,000 infected at a specific point in time in South Africa.

Infrared photos show that temperature differences between day and night likely indicate caves.
During the day, they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night, warmer instead.
“Their thermal variations aren’t as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but that’s consistent with them being deep holes in the ground,” said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff.
In France, voting traditionally takes place without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot paper into an envelope, on which they mark the candidate they have chosen.
After election officials verify the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballots were inside them before the start of voting and that no ballots other than those deposited by counted and eligible voters were added.
Candidates may send representatives who then witness the entire process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house at the moment of the car crash, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained a serious head injury.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was then charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is awaiting trial in custody on charges, but witness testimony could be compromised because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts viewed the publication of the photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists are evidently walking on thin ice if they publish photographs, etc., of suspects.”
The prosecution, responsible for the criminal proceedings, indicated to journalists that no further information would be provided at least until an indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document concerns border disputes in which Palestine wants to maintain borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly included are the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were under strict ranger supervision during the supplemental pest protection study, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with NPSW and NSW Inc (the Australian Shooting Sports Association), qualified volunteers were hired under the auspices of the association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of natural heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first cull received comprehensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEC as part of measures aimed at moving the country towards new elections.
The commission represented Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by failed elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck in Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported no damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later replaced the elderly woman because she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Liggins worked at the hospital, he began to focus on premature births in his free time.
His research showed that administering the hormone accelerates fetal lung maturation.
The Sin-chua agency reported that government investigators discovered two “black boxes” containing flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died overnight when there were two moons in the sky. Unique, just like herself. She was a strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels stated, “Luna was as crazy as I was… maybe even more so… I loved her and will miss her… hopefully she’s somewhere where she’s better off.”
A public opinion poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal elections showed that the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
The caretaker Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of survey respondents share this opinion and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding extreme opinions within the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays, at the Commonwealth Games, but doubts were raised about his eligibility due to his objections.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome the pain, as pharmaceuticals are prohibited on the Games grounds.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
The discovery, verified by several people using various hardware and software in early February, was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of delivering water to Earth along with organic matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how Earth formed since comets collided with it a long time ago.
53-year-old Cuomo began his term as governor at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed these rumors as "political chatter and recklessness."
There are speculations that they will attempt to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
Compared to technology based on ground radars, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
No special transport will be provided, overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking or park-and-ride available on site.
Concerns about a lack of transport options have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors, without team fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species evolved in as little as two generations, despite previous assumptions that the process would take much longer, due to interbreeding between native finches, medium ground finches and immigrant cactus finches and large cactus finches.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It is possible to roll it into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and woven. It can be split or pressed into slices.
It can be processed to a considerable thinness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That's called the pH value of a chemical. You can create your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Combine both dry powders together, then use clean, wet hands to form a ball.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will result in a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of wastewater drainage systems were found in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, which were visited by both men and women together.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you are using a satellite for the call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then reflects its signal almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and the field of view.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a large rocket, measuring over 100 feet.
The bicycle changed the world in an unprecedented way. The most significant impact it had was a substantial easing and speeding up of transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transport.
Beneath them are medium-sized felines, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) whose main dietary intake consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in a system of ecological niches, meaning that each cat has its own tasks which prevent it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
The pack consists of one to three related adult males together with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family made up of sisters and daughters.
A lion coalition behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar isn't like a lion's roar from a full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they have the opportunity, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by scent, identifying their passage by sniffing the ground to determine where they have moved.
At night, they see very well thanks to their night vision and can move very quietly. Ocelots hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then leaping onto their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or river, or move to a new island from which it is difficult to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in several thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their nourishment from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is of plant origin. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered in more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set embedded in the upper palate, meaning nothing that crossed his path stood a chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a forked tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may even have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water. Even a large dinosaur like, for example, T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their dishes wouldn’t be foreign to us, the Romans had their share of peculiar or unusual banquet compositions, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, while wealthy men preferred to host banquets together and recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that reached Europe from America or Asia only in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be its home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strove to satisfy the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, special tower-like structures with a pyramidal shape called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house wasn't so important.
Most of a Hebrew family’s life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the courtyard; shops were simply open counters facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, extensive forests were not found, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas state that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Green Land.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were part of "Scandinavia," there were many differences between the inhabitants, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words “Original Declaration of Independence July 4th 1776.” The text is on the underside of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is clear that the large parchment document (dimensions 29¾ x 24½ inches) was rolled into a scroll and stored shortly after its creation.
Therefore, it is likely that the entry was simply added as an afterthought.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
He was ruled by the French of "Vichy." These were Frenchmen who signed a peace treaty with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France. The invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a particular culture shared by a significant, large group of people who live and work in mutual cooperation, meaning they together form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning "civil," and is related to the Latin "civis," meaning "citizen," and also "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and simultaneously defines, in a way, the size of a society.
The predecessors of nations were city-states. The culture of civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of lasting cultural traces, and reasonable dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, operating under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments to enforce laws, which often did not cooperate.
It also had no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states and could only then be supplemented. The states took the central government lightly, to the extent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, and Italy won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, so Japan is actually the 7th largest island in the world!
Considering the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is sometimes referred to, in a geographical sense, as an "archipelago."
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous grain production practices while employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, units of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, under which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is comprised of three main sectors: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been renovated to give tourists a better idea of how the buildings originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the most prevalent film size at the peak of the analog film era.
They are still made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio was also adopted by the formats of digital camera sensors.
Although it's somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) equal or closely approximate this aspect ratio.
Often abused and ridiculed, the “rule of thirds” is simply a guideline that creates dynamism in an image while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most effective placement for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having acquired wealth and power, became the target of intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His pervasive power influenced everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s financial resources are here precisely for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church was in Rome for over 1,000 years. This concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective because it disrupted vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated universally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain patrolled international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since this tactic met with only limited reaction, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, attitudes of pacifism and isolationism prevailed among most citizens and nations.
Having witnessed the horrors and cruelty of World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Bachelor (his supervisor from a previous job).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war unfolded between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, during which thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that a country belongs to its people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to thrive.
The same applies to the army, as now abilities matter rather than military ranks based on social class.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to initiate a revolution in their own countries.
Mohamed was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly realm. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on a mountain called "Noor" (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, offers a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Due to its location on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Inside the cave, it is in complete isolation.
All that can be seen is a beautifully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the “Giza Necropolis,” in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor his wives and family members.
The “loop up” mark looks like the letter V, and the “loop down” mark looks like a paperclip or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you start at the tip and press down on the bow, down means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upward movement usually creates a softer sound, while downward movement is louder and more piercing.
You can write your own markings in pencil on the sheet music, however, keep in mind that the printed markings have a musical reason for being there and should therefore usually be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king’s sister Élisabeth Philippine d'Orléans were forced by a crowd of market women on October 6, 1789, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They returned to Paris by carriage, which was surrounded by a riotous crowd shouting threats at both the king and the queen.
The large crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one moment in Versailles, a member of the criminal group waved to the head of the royal guard before the horrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, while bond interest flowed through Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Extra profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would, of course, constitute a fundamental revenue stream for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the order’s creation.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called “technology push” or technological imperative, or perhaps the belief that human destiny is governed by an all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that significantly transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology has an “impact” on societies that is inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
We can, for example, say that the emergence of motor vehicles inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which drives the invention of new techniques in medicine to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically formed individuals, and over time, customs and a culture relating to this geography arose, and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the center of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was known as the center of fashion in feudal Europe.
His fame, as the epicenter of luxury, began around 400 AD and lasted roughly until 1100 AD.
Her importance declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that participants in the Crusades brought valuables back to Europe, such as silk and spices, which fetched higher prices at home than they did in the Byzantine markets.
It was precisely at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, dresses were significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advancements of this period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture practiced to produce only as much food as is needed to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple, often organic system utilizing seeds native to the given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have practiced subsistence farming, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, encompassing dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
Children like these are called “wolf children.” Some wolf children were kept imprisoned for extended periods (usually by their own parents), and in some cases, they lived abandoned because their parents rejected them due to severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma, after which they were abandoned or ran away.
It is claimed that the others were raised by animals, while some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, a feral child exhibits nearly identical behavior (within their physical capabilities) to the animal providing care, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should facilitate and make learning more engaging, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
A framework isn't a teaching method, but rather a support tool for individuals acquiring new skills, such as learning a new computer program or launching a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual as well as real; in other words, a teacher is a certain form of scaffolding, but so is a small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual Constructions designed to analyze, motivate, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for the student themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they lack proper nutrition, care, and upbringing, but such cases do exist.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should ensure all needs that were not met in the home from which the child was previously removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet add another dimension to usage and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivational factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continued interest” were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when examining audience responses to websites.
Using video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting microexpressions, you can find out if the other person is lying to you.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks suggested how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle differences between the two sets of genes in both directions within each generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to humans, it is difficult to satisfy the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savanna.
If they fail to do so, the consequences are severe: increasing depression, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant sources of protein would be those available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us primates to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors dealt with the problem of protein intake in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking from normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short period (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm while still sleepy, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Further options based on biorhythms include drinking a large amount of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as this forces a person to wake up and go to the toilet.
The level of inner peace a person experiences corresponds to the inverse of the level of tension in their body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good life force brings. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only thing preventing the path to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddha's teachings, but has been expanded to include the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are fundamentally very simple. They are kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through the postures of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. Clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries with the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted another 40 years, and fighting truly took place through proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and retreat and regrouping of forces along the Romanian Bridgehead represented the only hope.
However, these plans were almost immediately scrapped when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after troops invaded the eastern areas of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of a navy was to ensure the state’s ability to transport people and goods, but the navy was also meant to prevent the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was attempting to halt this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain, just as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were likely first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherds, frequently children or adolescents, similarly to the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although towpaths generally consisted only of parallel planks, they allowed draft horses to achieve greater speed and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually discovered that rails are more effective if they have a band of iron on their surface.
This became a common occurrence, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. The first all-iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known method of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedalism appears in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more in harmony with the environment, join environmental protection movements, and even become activists.
In many cases, it is the same as symptomatic treatment. However, if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and problems have grown as a result of overpopulation and humanity’s extravagant lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as “Dunlap prints.”
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the so-called Dunlap broadsides, a total of 25 prints from the Dunlap printing house. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many features that are reminiscent of dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits – or in computer jargon, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to establish an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
This term is derived from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both cleptoparasites and fleas are cunning and adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis are known, making this disease a leading neurological condition in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest or in the child’s best interest.
These couples may decide on a plan to adopt their child.
In the event of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method is, in fact, a guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not experimentation in and of itself. An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research, asking questions and observation are also important.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, above all, the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all areas of science, including psychology, were adopted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often fundamentally depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue a freely running cycle in time even without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey–Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether germline cells were affected.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities within this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people in cars leave small towns, drive to work, and pass others heading to the place they themselves have just left.
Everyone participates in and supports a transport system based on private vehicles on this dynamic shuttle transport system.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in life in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely encounter such a level of complaint about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail daily? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something deeper going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Investigating traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, as driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, traffic usually has a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them a greater selection of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite – that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
That sounds reasonable, because it doesn't seem to people that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth. More than eight times as much water flows through it as through the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed either in size or in the technical precision of their construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City includes around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be mined relatively easily, even with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are classified as metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been relegated to a lower position and secondary uses with the emergence of new writing methods.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't even come into contact with a pencil sharpener.
One can only marvel at what happens to a keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission nuclear bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It’s something like pulling a heavy cart uphill. By redistributing the atomic nucleus, some of this energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with slight or even no contact.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and around 100 km thick on the far side.
Under the sea it is weaker, and under the mountains it is stronger.
On the near side, there may be more lunar maria, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could thus more easily reach the surface.
Content theories are focused on determining what appeals to people or what is close to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.
These theories explore what motivates certain people to want to do what they do, and what in their environment leads them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues – peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain “one of them.”
This type of manager struggles with making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluation, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person changes beyond recognition and feels they must change everything the team is doing, and do it their own way.
The team leader is, after all, responsible for the team’s success and failure.
This discussion often leads to disagreements between managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as points of contact for their own physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet across different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so-called "invisible team" (Larson – LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
“The Invisible Team” is a management team to which every member reports. The Invisible Team sets standards for individual members.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organization? One of the goals for implementing the concept of a learning organization is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional components of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
The result is that the process of collaborating organizations to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes for serving customer needs.
In order for an organization to be innovative, its leadership must create an innovative corporate culture, implement knowledge sharing, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method organizations use to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to studying cognition, thereby narrowing and refining this research area.
Researchers are supported in their research by the interconnectedness between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for creating simulation models, which will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong association with science fiction, it constitutes a very important field of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include inspection, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, and recognition of handwriting, voice and faces.
Such things have become independent disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Field trips are an essential part of every subject. The teacher would often like to take her students to places where a bus trip is out of the question.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view artifacts from the museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of tours is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital every year. They redesign the site each year, but older versions remain online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve students’ writing skills. Although their blogging is often marked by careless spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger strives to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also “forces students to be aware of the world around them.” The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend their education beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “will enable students to improve their analytical and critical skills; through active responses to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their viewpoint on specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital city of Canada offering a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauty of the Muskoka region and more still await discovery.
All of this and much more emphasizes that Ontario is considered by foreigners to be a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people will be surprised by the following demographic fact: there are more African Americans living in the USA than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and in terms of wildlife, we can consider it a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries. It flourished on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route (Cape Route) from Europe to India.
In the north, the area is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers be listed as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also good to wear a ring (just be careful it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should be aware that due to cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment, and it is not uncommon for a man to follow a woman while walking, grab her hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't excuse it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, and abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of trinkets, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well-considered in light of the ongoing fighting that continues to take place in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and offers some of the most affordable gorilla trekking in Africa.
For getting around Goma, you can use boda boda (motorcycle taxis). A typical price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Timbuktu is a poor city today, but thanks to its reputation, it is a tourist attraction. It also has its own airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television program *Wonders of the African World*, hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the towns in the country, appearing more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the northeast of the Republic of South Africa, running along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and with the Crocodile River marking its southern boundary.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Similarly to all National Parks in South Africa, an entrance fee and a contribution to nature conservation are required here as well.
Purchasing a Wild Card can also be beneficial, as it allows entry to either select parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider a major travel destination.
The display of buildings that make up Hong Kong’s cityscape is likened to a glittering bar chart, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are obtained by leaving the island and heading to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's dense urban development is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the north shore.
This is a place that was appropriated by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world’s largest coastal mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stretches of mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water surfaces or wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that around 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian axis deer currently inhabit the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Considering that intercity buses are often full, we recommend purchasing your ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but traffic wasn't opened until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani tribe was the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area we now know as eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the “Great Province of the Indies”, emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
If you are interested in tournaments and where to get tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP) at a one-to-one rate.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West shop.
British pounds are widely accepted anywhere in the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted in the town of Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but you might have luck with British and American currency. Be sure to ask the owners in advance what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, summer is here when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but combined with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy and dry seasons here: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are accustomed to people, they are still wild animals in the wilderness, and therefore should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park regulations, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife!
Despite appearing peaceful, bison, deer, moose, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking.
Every year, many visitors are injured due to not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that bears and other wildlife are attracted to scents, so avoid carrying or cooking aromatic foods and keep your campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except for one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the highest-ranking chief, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches here considering Auckland lies between two harbours. The most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the popular suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland, by Waitemata Harbour.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," which isn't a particularly complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you can enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water is safe to drink here, however, bottled water is readily available if you are concerned.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but top-quality.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the cliff, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare.
Therefore, heed the advice of authorities, follow the signage, and pay careful attention to safety warnings.
Four-wheel drive vehicles are required near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy. They are occasionally found outside of this period as well.
Sharks really do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile doesn't live actively in the ocean; its primary refuge is the river mouths north of the town of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travelers the certainty that they will have somewhere to sleep at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is usually possible to book other types of accommodation through them as well, such as campsites.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even combined flight and hotel deals.
I can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think it over or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any modifications or requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp directly on site, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the heart of the action, you’ll need to arrive as soon as possible to secure a camping spot located close to the music performances.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has ended, music may continue in other areas of the festival late into the night.
Some festivals feature special campsites for families with small children.
If you travel across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as sailing through ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Passengers on cruises are not subject to visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos generally try to make guests spend as much time as possible and spend as much money as possible. They usually lack windows and clocks, and it's often difficult to find the way out.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers to keep visitors in good spirits and within the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the company’s tab. However, intoxication negatively affects one’s judgment, so all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or through a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and therefore you cannot drive as you would on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow falls in a very short time to make driving impossible.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or blowing snow, or by dew or ice on the vehicle's windows.
Ice and snow, on the other hand, are normal in many countries and traffic continues with few interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is arguably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and for many tourists represents the highlight of their entire trip.
The term "safari" in the strict sense refers to overland travel for the purpose of viewing stunning African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and the standard equipment therefore allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can observe them better with binoculars.
The tourist safari consists of a hiking tour lasting several hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it previously hosted them in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, this situation may be difficult for you.
Cancellation policies varied, but even at the end of March, most event cancellation policies based on coronavirus did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with standard tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available to borrow, even if they are not directly in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them in their home regions.
Problematic insects can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or, in more serious cases, allergic reactions, venomous poisoning, or the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are generally not classified as pests as such.
Shopping without duties presents an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and other fees in designated areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when purchasing products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, as it frequently runs through isolated, wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep angles, narrow lanes, and sharp turns prevail.
The maximum permitted speed here is significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to it is even more important.
Interestingly, however, mobile phone services work much better here than in many sections of the journey, for example, in the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and diverse, very similar to those of their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apples are used in baking all year round, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular desserts often pair well, especially with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some hearty sweets, try pastries known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either “dry” or “wet” depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the central regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used instead.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, if used without further specification, this term usually refers to cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, consists of many simply seasoned dishes where the flavors of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices predominate.
The stirrups, which hang on either side of the saddle, serve as support for the rider's legs.
They offer riders greater stability, but can be associated with safety issues due to the possibility of a rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but their foot gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts to run, it can drag the rider along with it. A number of safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a fine, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety stirrup bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle if a falling rider pulls on it.
Chochamó Valley – a popular climbing destination for the Chilean prime minister, known as the Yosemite of South America, where extensive granite walls and cliffs can be found.
Mountain peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes thanks to the endless potential of the local cliffs.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a common travel activity with many fans, sometimes known as "ski roamers," who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century. The first recreational ski club was opened in Norway, Australia in 1861.
Cross-country skiing: This activity is also referred to as ski touring, touring on skis, or ski trips.
It’s related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they aren’t part of this activity, with the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much sturdier skis and boots.
Imagine a ski slope as similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you will rarely move at a speed comparable to what you would achieve on cross-country skis without a heavy backpack and on a groomed trail.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with a number of independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through visa requests and passport control several times.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this regard much like one country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately in each Schengen country, which saves you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods over 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, for example, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques, even if they are newer than comparable mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sámi, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professions.
However, not all Sami traditionally engaged in large-scale reindeer herding; they also made a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer only as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern crafts. Tourism represents an important income in Sápmi, the area inhabited by the Sámi.
Although the term "cikán" is widely used, especially among the non-Roma population, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit becomes subject to travel advice, it may affect your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance.
You might want to look at the advice of other governments rather than your own, but that advice is primarily intended for their own citizens.
An example would be citizens of the USA, who may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory reports are merely brief summaries of the political situation in the country in question.
The presented opinions are often superficial, general, and overly simplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it takes various forms that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and wildfires are forms and consequences of stormy weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all possible risks of adverse weather in their area, as it may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for the term "Hostile Environment Awareness Training" will likely reveal the address of a local company.
The course typically covers all the problems described here in much greater detail, often including practical exercises.
The course usually lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing training, thorough first aid instruction, and sometimes weapons handling as well.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without indicating gender (X) or to update documents to reflect a requested name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies.
Security checks at checkpoints became much more disruptive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are returning waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topology, backflow concentrates in several deeper sections, and this is where a fast current into deep water can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere the current won't drag you away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether anyone has noticed you, wait for help instead.
The shock of returning home hits sooner than culture shock (with a smaller phase of initial enthusiasm), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to a new culture often have a particularly difficult experience readjusting to their native culture.
Upon returning from a stay abroad, you adjust to a new culture and have already lost some habits from your home.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also needed by travelers returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and silence even before the performance begins.
Usually, you constantly hear tourists and vendors here. The story of sounds and lights is reminiscent of a fairytale book.
The Sphinx functions as both a backdrop and a narrator of a long story.
Various scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and the individual pyramids are gradually illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by multiple countries and have the most bases – 16 were active there in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the mainland. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, these include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Antarctic Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here into a plateau, and then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part or along the Sentinel Range lies the highest mountain range of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif with its 4,892-meter peak, Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without mobile signal coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, because you need to be outdoors with no obstructions between you and the satellite in order to make a call.
This service is frequently used by maritime transport, including recreational vessels and expeditions that require remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It’s particularly popular with people finishing school, as it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad after finishing high school can improve your chances of higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are usually charged for enrollment in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boat trips. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” includes thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos as well.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on archipelagos and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks will offer a different experience.
Boatbuilding is a national pastime in Finland – there is one boat for every seven to eight people here.
Similarly, this is the case in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, this figure is one in forty).
Baltic Sea cruises usually include a longer stay in Russian St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit this historical city for several full days and return to the boat at night to sleep on it.
If you only go ashore as part of organized cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid since 2009).
Some tours in the brochure include German Berlin. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the tour price.
Traveling by airplane can be frightening for people of any age and background, especially if it's their first flight, or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal worries and aversions to other things that many people have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome fear of the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Shipping companies are well-paid for fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller firms are facing problems.
If they sent the goods by air freight, it could take several days for them to clear customs and be unloaded on some routes.
The only way to get it there faster is to send the item as checked baggage. However, airline regulations do not allow sending baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly in first or business class is to pull out a thick wad of cash (even better is to get your company to do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: you can expect to pay up to four times the price of a standard economy ticket in business class, and eleven times as much in first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't make sense to even look for discounts on flights from point A to point B for first or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a key group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and prices reflect that.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been plagued by various ethnic conflicts.
This conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir, with a population of around 3.7 million, is the third-largest city in Turkey, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a significant transport hub.
What was once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are interwoven with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of the Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
At the cemetery, you can see interesting marble dove statues above some graves.
A half-hour walk through this interesting village is worth it.
To the north and within easy reach lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners thanks to its beauty as described by Lord Byron.
Scotturb network bus number 403 runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, also visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-renowned site of Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass burial site, as well as a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a substantial portion of the world’s population.
Many men and women still live who survived internment at this place, and far more whose loved ones were murdered here or died of exhaustion from forced labor, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please behave with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves in this place. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place with signs or by scratching graffiti into the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half the population prefers Catalan, a significant majority understands it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs and notices are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is commonly used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, however, unplanned service disruptions are announced by an automated system in many different languages – in Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being selfish, rude, and arrogant people.
Although it’s often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave as impeccably as possible – in other words, to act like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-mannered). This will substantially ease your way.
The initial impression that Parisians are somewhat brusque quickly fades if you show even basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, particularly with beech, spruce, and fir, and offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to its diverse microclimate, varied soil, and differing altitudes, it supports significantly different plant communities.
The region is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
Besides many common species, rare fauna such as brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and black grouse can be discovered here.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide blankets to women who arrive unprepared, however, if you bring your own blanket, especially a colorful one, you’ll earn a smile from a monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can also borrow this from the stock at the entrance, but this clothing isn’t washed after every use, so you shouldn’t feel comfortable wearing these skirts. They only have one size for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and often utilizes olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is called Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredients, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie (you – formal), are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It likely also facilitates reading, even though the writing is somewhat complicated due to the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is being used in a nominalized form.
In Italian, pronunciation is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The capital letters to be careful with are C and G, as their pronunciation differs depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, pay attention to the different pronunciation of the letters 'r' and 'rr': "caro" means "expensive," while "carro" means "cart."
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So, if you read these grammar basics, you will learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand individual phrases.
It goes without saying that if you know any of the Romance languages, learning Portuguese will be easier for you.
However, people who know a little Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn’t need to be studied separately.
Observatories from pre-modern times are mostly obsolete today and serve as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution at their summits wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, making them more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were a beloved flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing celebrations were held by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even “just one” specimen.
If you visit a formally maintained garden, you will be immediately kicked out for collecting "specimens."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe country to visit. It’s also very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything there upon arrival.
However, given that it’s located in the “true tropics” just a few degrees north of the equator, you’ll have to contend with heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less often).
Some buses also run north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check whether the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an interesting place to go on vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire and Rhine valleys, or a tour of interesting cities on the Danube, or a cruise along the Erie Canal.
They also mark the routes of popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition where people stay up all night on Easter to watch the sunrise from a prominent location.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could just as easily be a pre-Christian spring and fertility festival.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, when the congregation often erupts in celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands swam there, flew there, or were brought by the wind or ocean currents.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to overcome it, and the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, a number of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to observe the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dark for the vast majority of the time.
Because these areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is generally not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the view of the stars as well.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to.
The standard attire for a businessman is a suit, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is key, with group effort being emphasized more than praising individual achievements.
Employees must obtain approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
