This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread; furthermore, it also provides details not found in fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional distribution.
Scientists believe that this animal's plumage was dark chestnut brown on top and carotenoid-colored underneath.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur lacks a well-developed shaft or rachis, but possesses other characteristics such as plumaceous and feathery barbs, researchers concluded that the rachis likely developed later than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying, but rather to regulate temperature or for display. Researchers suggest that, even if this is from a young dinosaur, the sample is of adult plumage and not from a hatchling.
Scientists suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not that of a hatchling.

The work that was done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by the tidal force between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth, causing the tides, the Way of Saint James exerts force in the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy settles around the galaxy in a halo, and is composed of abundant particles.

However, it does align with the idea that they are large holes in the ground,” commented Glen Cushing from the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is generally an experience that involves little technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot indicating their preferences into an envelope.
After the electoral board verifies the voter's identity, the voter casts their ballot into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no ballots present at the start of voting and that no more are added than those of the counted and authorized voters.
The different candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the afternoon, volunteers will count the votes under close supervision, following specific procedures.

Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
And the house was occupied by three people when the car crashed, they had no damage.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Yarmouth.
Afterwards, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya appeared in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh accused of killing her son.
He is under custody awaiting charges and trial, but any eyewitness will be under suspicion due to the public dissemination of his image.
It is common practice to sunbathe in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works very differently and the courts have seen such images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, highlights that “journalists could be risking their lives if they publish images and information of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, told journalists that no comment would be made, at least until the charges are filed.
The document, according to the leak, refers to the border dispute, which Palestinians want to be settled with the borders that existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other issues discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands ten years of permanent military presence in the valley after signing the agreement, while the PA agree to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control program had to be closely supervised by the guards, while the program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through the agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were selected within the association's game hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, interim director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first drive had comprehensive safety training and instruction.
Martelly took the oath of office in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
It's the fifth CEP from Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a set of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was the response Martelly gave to the thousands of protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests led to their inability to organize elections, some of which were supposed to be held in 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod malfunction due to overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said they had been sent 27 cases of accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “not serious.”
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake startled Mariana at 7:19 am local time (9:10 pm Friday GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the nation.
Additionally, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino police officer held several Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some of the held people have been rescued, and there are at least six confirmed victims.
Six hostages were released, including the guides and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then occupied the site of an old woman while she went to the washroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynecologist and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When she worked at Liggins Hospital, she began researching premature birth in her free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation could be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders ("black boxes") on Wednesday.
Her fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented that “Luna is as strange as I am… perhaps even more so… I love her and I will miss her… I hope she is in a better place.”
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by eight percent since 2008.
The acting prime minister, Julia Gillard, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Elizabeth II’s reign.
Thirty-four percent of the people in the survey share this viewpoint, wanting Elizabeth II of England to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the poll results, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was going to swim in the 100 and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition is in doubt.
She couldn't take the necessary medicine to overcome the pain because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number on January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery with extreme hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of bringing water to Earth along with organic material that could form proteins to support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planetesimals form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term at the beginning of this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as “political chatter and foolishness.”
It is speculated that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says would allow aircraft to make shorter flights, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology instead of the old technology based on terrestrial radar. This aims to allow air traffic controllers to establish the position of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more reliable information.
There is no extraordinary transport and the surface trains do not appear in Wembley, and parking and short-stay parking are not available on the surface.
The lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match would be played behind closed doors without the presence of the teams’ fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species evolved in as few as two generations, although this process was previously thought to take much longer, due to breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be given many forms. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be made into fine wire, to handle and braid it. It can be forged or made into planks with it.
It can be drawn very thinly and embedded in another metal. It could become so fine that sometimes it was used to decorate the miniatures of books called “illuminated manuscripts.”
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (basic) the substance is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder and then, with clean, wet hands, press it into a ball shape.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers. You’ll feel something strange as it forms a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in practically every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remains of flushing systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
There were also baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were together in crowded company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
I need a 100-foot rocket to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the invention did for us was to make transportation easier and faster.
We carry the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Below them there are medium-sized felines that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including common cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to success is the niche concept, a special job that each of the cats has and which prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the felines and live in large groups called prides.
Manoeuvres consist of one to three related males together with up to thirty females and young.
Women are often related to each other, forming a large family of daughters and sisters.
Lionesses’ hunting strategies work similarly to those of wolves or dogs, animals that resemble lions a lot (though not other big cats) in their behaviour and which are also very damaging to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete: it can climb (though not very well), swim, jump good distances and pull five times the strength of a human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar isn’t like the powerful roar of the lion, it’s like a sentence of hoarse words shouted.
Ocelots are given small animals to eat. They eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots smell and track animals to eat (hunt) using their sense of smell, following their trail on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging with the environment and jumping on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the original population (if they go to live in the mountains or the river, or move to an island from which they cannot easily return), they are usually found in an environment different from the one they had before.
This new environment has distinct resources and competitors, so the population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed a bit; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapted to its new environment, they began to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will become so different that they will no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable and important consequence for evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, release).
Plants make their own food by photosynthesizing sunlight. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Their huge jaws have more than 70 sharp teeth like knives with a strange game in the roof of their mouth, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses their path.
We aren't entirely sure yet, but it could have had a forked tongue. It ate turtles, large fish, mosasaurs, and may even have been cannibalistic.
He would attack anything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was a match for him.
While most of their food would seem familiar to us, the Romans had a good share of strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women eat their food sitting on chairs, rich men make feasts together where they will be lying on their sides while they eat.
The ancient Roman meals could not include food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, or cocoa. And no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered to be the god's house.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests strived to attend to the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and within it a inner sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes special tower-like structures in the shape of a pyramid, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The highest part of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
A large part of the Hebrew family's life was outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were counters that faced the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Nordic sagas, it is said that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while travelling west, he came across Greenland and named it accordingly.
But without taking this discovery into account, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
And although each of the countries is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written “Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776”. The text is at the end of the document, at the bottom.
And not only is it unknown who wrote it, but it is known that, initially, the parchment (measuring 29.75 by 24.50 inches) was rolled up for its storage.
Therefore, it seems likely that the notation will only appear as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north, but the south was still not liberated.
He governed under the Vichy regime, which was the French who allied themselves with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France. The invasion was called “Operation Dragoon”.
In just two weeks, the American forces and the Free French Forces would liberate the south of France and head towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a representative group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, is related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, which means city or city-state, and which, in a way, defines the greatness of society.
City-states are the precursors to nations. A civilizational culture implies passing on knowledge through many generations, a cultural rebound that is maintained and a significant spread.
Minority cultures are often dismissed, leaving our historically relevant contributions unacknowledged and failing to properly recognize them as civilizations.
In the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The congress had no power to levy taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it depended on the state authorities, who were not inclined to cooperate, to approve all laws.
It also lacked the authority to annul fiscal legislation or tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states paid so little attention to the central government that the representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most victorious team in the world and was the world champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in northern regions, and there are Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Considering the group of islands the country has, Japan is geographically an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1627, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and north coasts of Taiwan; they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, called Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex were reconstructed to give tourists a more reliable idea of how they originally were.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed-image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio was inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format paradoxically has a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (divide by 12 to reach the simplest whole number ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as those in the APS family, for example) have an equal or very similar proportion.
The rule of thirds, so ingrained and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
He asserts that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown wealthy and powerful, was subject to scrutiny.
The Christian religion had united different European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and culture.
His overwhelming power affects all strata of society, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church’s financial resources exist precisely for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led to questioning whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after beginning the mooring, Great Britain initiated the naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off military and civil supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted and ratified international law through various international agreements of the previous two centuries.
The United Kingdom placed mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, causing danger even to neutral vessels.
As the response to this tactic was poor, Germany expected a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the most widespread attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After experiencing the horrors and the atrocities of the war in World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States of America with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing distinct periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power was a distinctive dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of instability with divided provinces. The most well-known period of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between nobles who fought over the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi’an.
It stemmed from abundant social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to its people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, with the Revolution, positions opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and wealthy to succeed.
The same thing happens with the army because instead of basing military classifications on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in worldly matters. He used to go to a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
In the hollow of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies this cave, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find at all, even knowing of its existence. Once inside the cave, you are in total isolation.
One can see nothing more than the beautiful and clear sky and the mountains that surround it. Few things from this world enter this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramidal constructions made in accordance with the deceased pharaoh.
The Xiza plateau, or the “Necropolis of Xiza”, located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to pay homage to the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples to pay homage to his wives and relatives.
The indication for “uphill arch” resembles a V, and the indication for “downhill arch” a staple or a small square without the bottom line.
Up means to start by touching the top and pushing the bow, and down means to start on the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A higher arc generates a softer sound, while a lower one is louder and more assertive.
You can take notes, but remember that the printed arc markings are there for musical reasons and must be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old), and the king's sister, Elizabeth of France, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a crowd of working women from the market.
Now that the carriage had departed, they travelled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people cheering and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At that moment, a member of the noble class kicked the head of a Royal Guard murdered in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the Philippine War were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds advanced in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
From the outset, the super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of Filipinos were the main gains of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which events unfold is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and it was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses in practice a rich set of ideas, ranging from technological drive or technological imperative to a strict sense in which the human destiny is dominated by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path far removed from political or cultural influence, and that technology, for its part, has effects on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the car necessarily fosters the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable with only a handful of cars, so new production methods should be developed to lower the cost of car ownership.
The possession of a large number of cars also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a lot of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time habits and cultures linked to this geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is seen as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was seen as the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
His status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was then that the title of Fashion Capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style originated in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing in the east was very influenced by Byzantine culture.
However, through slow communication channels, Western styles could lag 25 or 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the period was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is done to have enough production to cover the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often ecological system that uses seeds from the local area along with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers developed subsistence agriculture, and this is what happens in many developing countries.
Subcultures group together similar individuals who feel rejection of societal standards and help them develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic of the age, ethnicity, class, place and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine what makes a culture distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture tend to show their belonging through the use of a distinct and symbolic style, which includes fashions, gestures and slang.
One of the most common methods for showing the importance of socialization is to point to the few and unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not socialized with adults while growing up.
Call these children “wild ones” or savages. Some were confined (generally by their own families and more); in some cases, this abandonment of children is due to the parents’ rejection of a severe physical or mental disability.
Children with behavioral problems may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is supposed that some were raised by animals; of others it is said that they lived alone in the wild wilderness.
When raised from birth by non-human animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that assists individuals who are going through a learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office paperclip man.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and aims to question, remind, and explain the procedures that students may have found difficult to manage on their own.
Children go to foster homes for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment lacking care, education and affection, but they do.
We believe that the Family Welcome Service is a safe environment for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, caring foster parents, regular education, and quality healthcare.
It is assumed that foster homes provide all the resources they lacked in the home they were removed from.
The internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The specific features of the Internet lend themselves to additional dimensions that challenge the uses and gratifications theory.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and ongoing relationships were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their research on public reaction to websites as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is asserted that no one can detect if someone is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work *The President’s Speech*, indicated that people who are unable to understand language due to brain damage are, however, capable of evaluating sincerity accurately.
He suggests that these skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century showed that there are two genetic reserves: latent and expressed.
Mutation introduces genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination generate variation between two genetic pools with each generation.
On the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Loving, not doing it has serious consequences: it increases depression, poor nutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources to find would be the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
Interestingly, ants, termites, and eggs are not only easy to digest but also provide proteins containing essential amino acids.
Considering all these things, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of waking up voluntarily during your usual sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily using a not very loud alarm that wakes you up without startling you awake.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a famous diuretic) before sleeping, forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life energy is. Every person has the ability to reach complete peace and joy.
Every person can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent us from doing so is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it expanded with the path of love of Mahayana and with many techniques of Indian yoga.
Initially, Tibetan Buddhism is quite perceptive. It comprises kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love and acceptance.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and conscious illumination is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States of America. With the end of the war, clashes between the systems, processes, and cultures led to the estrangement of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies and the Cold War began.
It was going to last the next 40 years and was going to be fought in truth by auxiliary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, after more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Armed forces are responsible for ensuring that the country maintains its ability to move citizens and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move population and goods.
One of the most notable nearby examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The United States was trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the time, the German navy, using submarines extensively, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have conquered Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazing areas, and were tended by goatherds, who were often children or young people, similarly to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of care are still used today.
The first railways were built in England in the 16th century.
And the wagonways were nothing more than parallel wooden planks, allowing the horses pulling them to gain more speed and haul larger loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
The planks were soon introduced to support the rails. Gradually, however, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
This became a normal practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of transport is walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Australopithecines, and their predecessors, didn't walk upright so often.
Bipedalism was found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked upright seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmentalist movement, and we can be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
It's like a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we will need to find the root of the problems, and we will have to disable it.
It's quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advances of science and human technology; problems are only growing due to overpopulation and a wasteful lifestyle.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to the nearby printing shop of John Dunlap.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Broadside."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
Once it was sent to George Washington on June 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. Another copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 families known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
There are many who don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and glide.
And there are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have paws with scales and spurs, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers today handle information encoded in a binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are too general to make an early diagnosis.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medicines or household chemicals.
Read the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison in particular.
The term "bichu" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects adapted to parasitizing humans.
Bed bugs and reduviid bugs cause damage, settling to live in the home or house of whoever shelters them.
In the United States, there are around 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not what suits them best, or what suits them best as a couple.
These parents can choose an adoption plan for their child.
Following an adoption, the biological parents lose their parental rights so that another couple can have them over the child.
The primary objective of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not only experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to discard one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions, making observations, and guiding scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that rhythms in psychology and behavior largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their manifestation in internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, are documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustained oscillators that follow a free-running cycle period even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was conclusive in determining that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, viruses, to introduce their DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments, clearly marking the phage’s DNA with a radioactive phosphorus or the phage’s protein with a radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type, the importance of the fragment of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells have genetic transmission, although other types of mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Some examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks to study information about their ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and cross paths with people who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport hub, the whole world is connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this carbon-intensive economy displaced the biosphere from one of the stable states that facilitated human evolution over the last two million years.
A lot of people participate in society and use means of transport. Almost everyone complains about those means of transport.
In developed countries, you almost never hear the same level of complaint about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints? Why do they do it daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows are usually fairly constant and can be represented, approximately, mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design, and carry out the construction of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly served them to escape enemies more easily and find food and reproduce successfully.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the sun.
Some people thought I was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems to be what the senses perceive, because it doesn’t seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the largest river on Earth. It carries over 8 times the discharge of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world because in some points it reaches 6 miles [wide].
20 percent of the water that reaches the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
And although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size nor the technical excellence of the pyramids of Giza were ever surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were already well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The City of Vatican employs Italian in its legislation and communication.
Italian is the usual language of most workers in the state, while Latin is also used in religious ceremonies.
Most citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Several basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, or copper have been known since antiquity, and all of them can be discovered in nature in native metal form, being easy to extract using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, had the theory that all things are made of mixtures of one or more elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was rather like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they changed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is composed of minuscule particles, atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that you could fit trillions of them into the period that ends this sentence.
Indeed, that invention, the pencil, made life easier for many people.
Sadly, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil is relegated to a lesser status and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to touch a typewriter.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb uses the principle that energy is required to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It’s like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Breaking the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no prompting.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is around 70 km thick at its closest point and 100 km at its furthest.
She is more slender in the seas and bigger in the high lands.
There were more maries in the nearby layer because the seam is finer. It was easier for the lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have several needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what it is in certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs or Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors emerge when managers begin to direct their former colleagues. One extreme is to continue being “one of them.”
This type of boss has a hard time making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone is quiet and becomes an unknown individual who believes they must change everything the team did and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional ones, but there are slight differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
Remote workers have more autonomy than conventional team members, as they can meet according to different time zones, something that local management may not understand.
The presence of an “invisible team” of truth (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which all members refer. The invisible team sets the standards for its members.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of creating a learning organization? One of the methods for introducing learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome an obstacle within an organization can lead to a new, innovative process that is geared towards customer needs.
Before the organization can innovate, leadership must generate a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous perspective as a method used for organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data show physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the research of cognition. Therefore, the research area narrows and becomes much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that brain damage of various types—trauma, injuries, and tumors—affects our behavior and causes changes in some mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that would never have been seen before.
That provides a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
And although AI sounds like something out of science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in a machine.
Research in Artificial Intelligence enables machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognizing handwriting, voices and faces.
Those fears were transformed into separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and it was built for the benefit of personal computers and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, the teacher would take and lead the students to places you can’t get to by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual excursions. Students can see museum objects, visit an aquarium, or interact with works of art while they are in the classroom.
Sharing a hike is also a very good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to City Capital; they remodel the previous one, but keep the versions so they can serve as templates.
Blogs can also help improve a student’s writing. While students may start a blog with careless grammar and spelling, the pressure of an audience often changes this.
As the student body is usually the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing to avoid those criticisms.
Participating in a blog also "helps students achieve greater knowledge of the world around them." The need to capture the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is an activity that stimulates collaboration and motivates students to also learn outside of schools.
The good use of blogs “motivates students to critical analysis; with active exposure to content on the Internet, students define their opinions with the texts of others and form their stance on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the Canadian capital of charm and bilingualism, and it has a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the north boasts the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka area and beyond.
That and more makes Ontario the basic Canadian [experience] for people from abroad. (Note: "foriato" carries a nuance of being foreign/from outside, and "lo básico" implies a fundamental experience or introduction to Canada.)
There are large areas in the north with little population, some of which are practically uninhabited areas of rough terrain.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in and of itself when it comes to animal life.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury tourist and beach centers.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, with a particular focus on Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that women state they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It really helps to wear a ring (even if it doesn't look very expensive).
Women have realized that cultural differences can turn out to be what they consider inappropriate, and it’s not uncommon for them to follow us, hold our arms, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't hesitate to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it is not admissible).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, abandoning it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established bases there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old medina, it’s easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tahini, ceramics, leather goods, pipes and a wealth of trinkets, all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, to make any visit outside of Goma you need to inquire about the state of the fighting that is occurring in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the cheapest places in all of Africa to take excursions to see mountain gorillas.
You can take a boda-boda (mototaxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short journey.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a makeshift city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination. It has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops for Henry Louis Gates in the PBS special “Wonders of the African Word.”
The city has a subtle contrast with the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting a different type of life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Regarding the five national parks of South Africa, they have conservation and park access fees.
It might be worth buying a Wild Card, which allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists visit as the main attraction.
The row of buildings that makes up the urban landscape of Hong Kong has been compared to a bright bar graph, aided by the presence of the water of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, which is directly opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the north coast.
This is the place the British colonists seized as their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland into Bangladeshi and Indian territory.
The Sundarbans was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The mangrove forest area in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not of the mangrove type, but rather maintain remnants of the majestic jungles that covered the Llanuras del Ganxes plains.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, a third of which corresponds to aquatic or marshy areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been an animal sanctuary; currently, there are about 400 Bengal tigers and about 40,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses leave from the intermodal station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, perhaps most of them, especially those going east or to Jakar/Bumthang, between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
As buses between districts are usually full, it is recommended to buy the ticket days in advance.
To most districts, small Japanese coastal buses arrive, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and affordable way to get to nearby areas such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l’Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.5 m wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Its construction finished in August 2011, but it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, the date by which the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group that lived in what is today eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region sheltered other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who lived from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, known as "the giant province of the Indies," was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest annual competition is held in December at the polo field of Las Cañitas.
Here, more modest tournaments or matches at other times of the year can be seen.
For tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is valued at par with the British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the bank on the islands, in the town of Stanley (opposite the FIC West shop).
Sterling books are generally accepted on the islands and in Stanley, as are credit cards and American dollars.
On remote islands it’s common for credit cards not to be accepted, although British or US currency is. Check with the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is practically impossible to exchange currency for the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving there.
They say that Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above 30ºC are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the air and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There isn't really a "rainy" or "dry" season in particular: rainfall remains pretty much the same throughout the year.
And many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the animals are wild and should not be bothered or fed.
According to park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how gentle they may seem, bison, moose, bears and other large animals can attack you.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These animals are large, clumsy and potentially dangerous, so you have to respect their space.
You should be aware that sweets attract bears and other types of animals; it’s best to avoid carrying candy or cooking sweet dishes and leave the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
La Concha was the setting for an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven German, British, and American ships refused to abandon it.
They scuttled all the ships, including a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city escalated into the murder of chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, especially around Auckland between two bays. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the north coast (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean; they stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all of them are beaches with golden sand and most have areas with pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are usually beaches full of families with a variety of shops nearby. It’s safe to swim.
The main local beer is “Number One”, which isn't complex but rather pleasant and fresh. The other local beer is “Manta”.
There are numerous ways to taste French wine, but New Zealand and Australia might travel better.
The water from the tap in the area is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you don't trust it.
For Australians, the idea of a “flat white” coffee is something foreign. An espresso is an “espresso”, a cappuccino comes with cream to the top (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate is as good as Belgian chocolate. The juice is expensive but excellent.
They fare well with trips to the coral reef all year round, and injuries due to these causes there are rare.
However, follow the recommendations, respect the signs, and be careful with safety measures.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and rivers from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes be found outside of these dates.
Sharks exist, however, it is rare for them to attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and swim away if they see them.
Marine crocodiles do not live entirely in the sea. Their primary habitat is the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Making a reservation in advance gives peace of mind to the traveler and ensures you have a place to sleep upon arriving at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it is possible you may find other accommodations such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include lunch, transportation to the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any change or request must be managed with the travel agency first, not directly with the hotel.
At many festivals, most attendees decide to camp, and for many it is an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the stages, you have to go early to camp close to the music.
Keep in mind that even though the music ends on the main stages, there will be sections of the festival that will continue playing music very late at night.
Many festivals have camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, look where the cabin is: if you sail with ice there's a lot of noise.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. A visa is not required for cruise passengers (see terms and conditions).
Casinos strive to maximize the time and money customers spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and the exits are difficult to find.
Generally, they have special food, drinks, and entertainment offers, to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay on the premises.
Some people offer alcoholic beverages for free. However, being drunk is being out of luck, and all good gamblers know the importance of being sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy or snowy roads, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
It's snowing, and it could snow enough to cause blockages very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall, blizzards, or by ice condensation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic flows without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a meaningful experience for visitors.
The term popularly used, "safari," is used to refer to overland trips to observe the beautiful African fauna, especially that of the savanna.
Many animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and the standard equipment allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards can be cowardly, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a “savanna walk”, “hiking safari” or going “patiar”) consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having already hosted the games of 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before it was postponed, you may be in a complicated situation.
Policies vary, but since the end of March most cancellations due to coronavirus do not cover July 2020, the dates of the Games.
It is estimated that most tickets will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with an average price of 7,000 ¥.
Ironing clothes while damp can help to dry them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, although they may not be in the room.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't feel like ironing even your socks, you can try using a hairdryer (if you have one).
Be careful that fabrics don't reach high temperatures (which can cause them to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to filter water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you had a weakening [of the water supply] you should consider buying bottled water from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter plagues of animals to which they are not accustomed in their countries of origin.
Plagues can spoil food, cause irritation or, in a worse case, provoke allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered plagues.
Shopping in duty-free shops is the way to buy goods exempt from direct and indirect taxes in certain places.
Travellers going to countries with high taxes can save a good amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated and wooded terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, you have to be careful: steep hills, narrow lanes and tight bends are common.
The speed limits on the signs are much lower than in the preceding and following sections—typically 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h)—and it is very important to stay within them.
Surprisingly, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than in many other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples as an ingredient all year round and with peaches and plums appearing in summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes usually pair well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try delicious doughnuts, try those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
The curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
The chestnut can be “dry” or “moist” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland northern regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used with curry; in the south of India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is the term that encompasses the enormous variety of regional cuisines of the country.
However, if no further adjectives are used, the term refers to food originally from the center and east of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers an abundance of simple dishes. The predominant flavour is that of peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and some aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet to hang on either side of the saddle.
They give more stability to the rider but can compromise their safety due to the risk of their feet getting trapped.
If a rider falls from a horse but has their foot caught in the stirrup, they can end up being dragged if the horse runs. To reduce this risk, some safety precautions must be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, thin sole.
Further back, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the saddle if a rider pulls on it when falling.
The Cochamó Valley – a main destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with an abundance of large granite walls and cliffs.

Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending snowy terrain with skis or a board attached to your feet.
Skiing is a very popular activity, sometimes called “ski addicts”, who plan entire trips to ski in a specific area.
The idea of skiing comes from way back – cave paintings amuse skiers from dates as remote as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport began in the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: also called cross-country skiing, backcountry skiing, or hiking skiing.
They’ve won it, but it doesn’t necessarily involve the displacements of skiing or mountaineering; the latter discipline is done on steep terrain and requires skis and boots much more rigid.
Think of a ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you’ll be the one to cover longer distances than walking – but very rarely will you be able to reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack and on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through many countries would mean having to request many visas and go through passport controls many times.
However, the Schengen Area functions as if it were a single country in this respect.
While you remain in this area, you can cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa you don’t need to apply for visas for each member country of the area; you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal consensus on what products are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations; the legal age can be younger in North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are more modern than some mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important way of life among the Sami, and the culture surrounding the profession is important to many workers in other professions as well.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, leaving reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Today many Sami work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Despite its widespread use, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gitano" is generally considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel cancellation insurance or your doctor may be affected.
You might want to consult the advice of other governments in addition to your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East will have to face extreme situations that Europeans or Arabs do not.
Warnings are a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are usually superficial, general and simplistic in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions is a generic term for any meteorological phenomenon that can cause damage, severe problems, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it comes in several types, which can depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

People undergoing three-gender transitioning cannot be expected to go through scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns from waves breaking offshore, usually in a channel or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return current concentrates in a few deeper sections, potentially forming a fast current for deep water.
Most deaths are the result of the fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to go to a place where you won't get trapped again, or, depending on your skill or if they've seen you, it might be better to wait for rescue.
The readjustment shock comes sooner than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who don't have trouble adjusting to a new culture often have difficulty readjusting to their own native culture.
When you return home after living abroad and have adapted to the new culture, you sometimes lose some customs of your native culture.
When speaking to a foreigner for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The light and music show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids.
Well, see the pyramids at dusk and then watch in silence before the show ends.
Sometimes you get tired of the noise made by tourists and vendors. The light and sound show is like a story.
The sphinx is both the setting and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are hidden in the pyramids and the extreme pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by numerous countries and have the most bases – sixteen active ones in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest city is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still-active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau and rise again to form the 360km of the Ellsworth Mountains, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northernmost part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors and with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service was frequently used for maritime transport, in addition to recreational boats, and expeditions requiring remote access to data and voice.
The local telephone provider can give you more information when connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It’s very popular among graduates, because they can take a year out before starting university, without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, taking a gap year abroad can improve your chances of progressing to higher education in your home country.
There is usually a registration fee for these educational programs.
Finland is a splendid destination for sailing. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In our archipelagos and lakes, you don't need a yacht.
And the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, but smaller boats or even canoes offer a different experience.
Sailing is the national pastime of Finland, which has a boat for every seven or eight people.
This figure is also reached in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is unique in another way (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises make a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days even if you return and sleep on the boat at night.
If you only disembark on excursions, you are exempt from needing a special visa (since 2009).
Several cruises include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can cause anxiety in people of all ages or backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have traumatic experiences.

For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome a fear based on the unknown and on not being in control.
Courier companies are paid well to deliver things quickly. Usually, time is very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and for smaller businesses this is a problem.
If they send things by air connection, on some routes it can take days for them to clear through unloading and customs.
The only way to send it there is as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that’s where you come in.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to spend a good amount of money for the privilege (but it’s even better if your company pays for it for you).
However, this is not cheap. As a general rule, it is normal to pay up to four times the price of the economy fare for business class, and up to 11 times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth looking for discounts on first or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know full well that there’s a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of getting there quickly and in comfort, and they charge them accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldavia is a multiethnic republic that suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1944, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which established its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member of the UN.
Economic ties were established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The majority religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a good transport hub.
It was once the ancient city of Smyrna, but now it is a modern and developed city, a commercial hub in a huge gulf surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with red-tiled buildings, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city’s atmosphere is more Mediterranean European than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble dove sculptures by the tombs.

Please remember that you are visiting, above all, a mass grave, as well as a place that has incalculable value for a large part of the world’s population.
There are still many survivors, and many more whose loved ones were taken, killed, or forced to work there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not scratch or graffiti the structures of the site.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Around half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is only in Catalan because the law establishes that it is the first official language.

The metro announcements are only made in Catalan, but incident reports are issued in various languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, lazy and spoiled.
And although this advice is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris remains to behave as well as possible, acting like someone who is “well-bred” (well-educated). It will make getting around much easier.
The rudeness of Parisians disappears quickly if you show basic politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a lot of woodland, generally beech and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably high diversity of plant communities, due to the many microclimates, different soils and variety of altitude levels.
The area is also home to a great variety of animals and birds.
Here you can find scarce fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the golden eagle, and the pheasant, as well as many other more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries give clothes to the women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colours, you’ll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same vein, it is requested that men wear trousers under their knees.
These can be kept in the entrance hall, but this clothing isn't washed after every use, so you might not be comfortable wearing these skirts. Men’s clothing is one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, even though similar to those of other Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, meat (especially pork) and uses a lot of olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and any available garnish such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Proper nouns, in addition to the word “you,” will always begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
It is quite important to distinguish between verbs and objects.

The pronunciation of Italian is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The letters we most need to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation is different depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, make sure to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: caro means loved and carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Indeed, reading this basic grammar is useful for learning quite a bit of Persian grammar and helps to understand sentences better.
It goes without saying, if you know a Romance language, that learning Portuguese will be easy.
However, people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese seems close enough not to need studying it.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and are preserved as museums or educational sites.
Light pollution wasn't initially the problem it is today; therefore, they are usually found in cities or towns because they are more suitable than modern ones.
Most modern research telescopes are very large facilities in areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Seeing the cherry trees in bloom, what is known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where ciruela flowers were the preferred ones.
The first Japanese cherry blossom viewing party was organized by the emperor, but only for himself and other members of the Imperial Court aristocracy.

Check that the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways are a good travel topic.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or going on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They are also the basis for hiking and cycling routes.

Many of the traditions of the festivals were also adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christian people throughout the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some exposed place to see the dawn.
There are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian fertility and spring ritual.
Some of the most traditional churches hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations begin to celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
Most of the animals that originally came to the islands arrived swimming, dashing, or floating.
Due to the great distance to the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, with the giant tortoise being the main grazing animal of the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs have been introduced.
If you visit areas of the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun won't rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky will be dark all day, more or less.
As the areas have very little population and, therefore, light pollution is not usually a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are the typical business attire, and colleagues are called by their last names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is very important, emphasizing teamwork more than individual achievements.
Workers usually need to get approval from their superiors for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
