This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils normally cannot deliver, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were ochre-brown on top with a whitish or carotenoid-colored underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur plumes lacked a well-developed shaft (called a rachis), but possessed other feather characteristics – barbs and rays – researchers have concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to those other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren’t used for flight, but for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have proposed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the evidence comes from adult feathers and not from the down of a hatchling.
Researchers have proposed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the evidence comes from adult feathers and not from the plumage of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at police headquarters in Gaziantep (Turkey), killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said: Nine of the injured were police officers.
The police said they suspect an alleged ISIS activist of being responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic reversals.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as it affects normal matter.
This theory posits that most dark matter is found in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant "is very worrying and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were infected by hospital staff.
In one year, one infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed ballot indicating their candidate choice into an envelope.
After election officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French voting law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes inside at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those from properly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to observe any part of the process. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's giant slalom sitting with a combined time of 4.41.30, 2.11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1.09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in the women's seating group could not finish their descent, and 45 out of a total of 117 female skiers in the giant slalom did not qualify.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and phone.
The deputy of Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have confiscated their mobile phone and laptop."
The convicts were Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The Chief of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with covered faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was urgently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeboya was remanded in custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending indictment and appearance in court, but all witness testimonies could be inadmissible, as her photo was widely published.
That is common in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes, "that journalists seem to be walking a dangerous tightrope when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecution overall, informed journalists that no further comments would be given until the indictment.
According to the file, the document refers to the disputed border area that Palestine claims based on the borders prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
Further discussed themes include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence for ten years in the valley, as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to agree to this presence for five years.
The protective measures in the supplementary pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director for park protection and heritage at the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected shooters received comprehensive instructions on safety and training for the first shooting operation.
Martelly swore in a new provisional Electoral Council (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The recent violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it is aware of 27 accidents related to the appliances.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had shared 34 further cases of overheating with them, which the company designates as "not concerning."
The Ministry reacted to Apple’s delay of the report by calling it "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 a.m. GMT on Friday).
The Emergency Management Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage has been reported across the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there is no seaquake warning for a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six spirits, including children and elderly people, were released early, just like the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who had to use the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained to become an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his free time.
His research showed that when a hormone was released, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their last respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremists. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as me… maybe even a little more… I loved her and miss her… hopefully she’s in a better place."
Of the 1,400 voters before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia as a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of survey respondents share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
And among those surveyed, 29 percent believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist is expected to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been questioned due to his complaints.
He was not allowed to take medication to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Some people had verified the discovery with the help of different hardware by the beginning of February, and that was announced on a Tuesday.
Comets were likely, together with organic substances that can form proteins and support life, a source for water supplies to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo took office as governor at the beginning of this year with 53 and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of tons of fuel and reducing CO₂ emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport means are deployed and holding areas are not located at Wembley, and parking spaces and Park & Ride facilities are not available on the ground floor.
The fear of lacking transportation has increased the possibility that the game might have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A Thursday study published in Science reported on the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into any conceivable form. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into thin wire, which can be twisted and tempered. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and applied to other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures and books, called "illuminated manuscripts."
That is designated as the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with the help of juice from red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color, depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing them to swell and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had, in almost every house, a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of wastewater systems have been found.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. With the Romans, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women gathered in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in view.
It takes a huge rocket over 30 meters high to bring a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an indescribable way. The greatest benefit we owe to the wheel is much faster and easier transportation options.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them, there are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and red deer.
Finally, there are many small carnivores (including free-roaming house cats) that eat a much larger number of small prey than insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the friendliest cats, living in large groups, also called prides.
A pack consists of one to four adult males, together with up to thirty females and young.
The women are generally close-knit families with each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Badgers behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs – animals that are surprisingly similar in behaviour to lions (but not other big cats) – and they are also very deadly for their prey.
As a well-muscled athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s glasses aren’t like the perfectly aligned glasses of a lion, but rather like a sentence crumpled, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find prey (catches) by sniffing where they were on the ground.
They can see and move very well in the dark with night vision. Ocelots hunt their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (as if they move over a mountain or a river, or if they colonize a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one they were previously in.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, meaning the new population needs new qualities or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to their new surroundings, they begin to look less and less different from the existing population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their nourishment from the sun through photosynthesis. They also offer shade.
We build our houses and produce our clothes from plants. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything except another Mosasaurus.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, together with an additional set on the gums, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
He also swallowed everything that came into the water; even a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't compete with him.
Although most of their food seems familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while the poor people and women sat quietly and ate, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Traditional recipes in the Old World could not have contained foodstuffs that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't like, for example, neither corn, nor tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no old Roman ever suffered from a craving.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and the priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
In ancient times, special pyramid-shaped towers – called ziggurats – were built to be part of the temples.
The tip of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Far East, houses weren't as important.
The greatest part of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
The women were cooking in the garden, the shops were only open briefly on the street. Stone was used for the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. It is said in the Nordic sagas that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he travelled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, independently of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each Scandinavian country was Scandinavian, there were many differences regarding people, customs, traditions and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is located at the bottom of the inverted document.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
It is therefore likely that the annotation was simply added as a label.
The landing on D-Day and the following battles had liberated Normandy, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in Southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After barely two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, meaning civic, related to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, and also somehow determines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilization's culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and an orderly dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirty states formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation – with Congress being its sole component.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and as there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
He also has no power to enact tax laws and excise duties between states.
The clauses required unanimous agreement from all states before they could be amended, and the states kept the central government on a short leash, so that their representatives were often resistant.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and was FIFA World Cup champion in 2006.
Popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan comprises nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the sixth-largest island country in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan has its origins as early as the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the core production of the indigenous people, and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most widely used photo format for still images worldwide, for example, is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but above all its aspect ratios have been taken over by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is, actually – which one can shorten a bit – 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore denoted as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format family) correspond to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The much-misused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while simultaneously maintaining a measure of order within an image.
It is understood that the most effective place for the main subject lies at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Her pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the Church exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified through numerous international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, which even put neutral ships in danger.
As little and limited reaction was given to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States of America to take up a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived at Thomas Edison in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a volume of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his last job).
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different eras: each phase of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of uncertainty with fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these eras was the Epoch of the 'Three Kingdoms', which lasted 60 years and lay between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi’an.
There were many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were available for all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to seize the opportunity.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army lists based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also encouraged other oppressed workers in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He repeatedly visited a cave, which became known as 'Hira' on Mount 'Noor' (Light) for contemplation.
Hell itself, which has endured for centuries, offers a very revealing picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The hole lies on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, she's not easy to find at all, even if one knows she exists. If one is in hell, one is completely isolated.
You can only see the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. When one is in a hole, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, there are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and some of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were erected to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The "bookmark upwards" looks like a V and the "bookmark downwards" like a parenthesis or a square, with the bottom side missing.
Above means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and below means that you should start at the fresh (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A stretch generally produces a more diffuse sound, while a stroke is more forceful and definitive.
Don't hesitate to add your own markings in pencil, but don't forget that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons and should therefore normally be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women from Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and yelled threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a participant in the mob held up the head of a murdered royal guard from Versailles before the terrified queen.
The costs of the US imperialism’s war of conquest in the Philippines were paid for by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, and a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds flowed through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people represent the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that celebrated the creation of the world.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally came to an end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept encompassing a broad spectrum of ideas and practices, ranging from technology-push or technological necessity to a strict belief that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent to it, rather than socially conditioned.
One could, for example, say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
A country-wide road network, however, is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce costs for vehicle owners.
The increasing motorization also leads to a higher accident rate on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with romance, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures have arisen that are connected to this geography, and which were, because they stood in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The wealth of the Levant was largely explained during the twelfth century by the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital of Constantinople was passed on to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture had a very strong influence on Gezei in the East.
Styles in the West, however, could be 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments from that time as a result of the Crusades was that people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that combines resources from the eco-region with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimise yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be defined by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods for illustrating the meaning of socialization consists of referring to a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse by adults while growing up.
Children born with this condition were called "wild children." Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); and in some cases, this abandonment of the child was traceable to the parents’ inability to cope with severe mental or physical disabilities.
Young runaways may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being given up or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When a child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviours (within physical limits) that closely resemble those of the respective rearing animal, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather support that assists people experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the small paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are implemented in the software and should inquire about, prompt, and explain procedures that students might have found too difficult to manage on their own.
Children are placed in care facilities for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, through abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not conducive, social, and educational, but that is just the way it is.
We see the flight system as a safety zone for these children.
Our flight system should offer a safe home, nursing staff with a very warm approach, stable training and reliable healthcare.
The flight assistance should provide all necessities that were missing from the home they were previously removed from.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions regarding usage and gratification approaches.
Learning and socialisation, for example, are considered important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal engagement” and “unhealthy relationships” were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions – facial movements of a few milliseconds.
Above all, it is claimed that one can recognize if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech," pointed out how people who cannot understand language due to brain differences are nevertheless able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities are shared in the interpretation of human behavior by animals such as domestic chickens.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
The separation and recombination move the variation with each generation back and forth between the two pools.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to cover its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, there are severe consequences if you don't do that: wasting disease, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins and leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast to this, animal-based foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a wealth of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, I shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10–60 minutes later).
That can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
When you set the clock back during sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, so that you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces you to get up to urinate.
The degree of moss and inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the Mahayana path of love and through many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is quite simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the collision of systems, processes and cultures led to the downfall of countries.
Two years after the world wars, the former Allies developed into enemies, initiating the Cold War.
It should take the next 40 years and be truly waged by proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in similar other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost immediately thwarted when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across oceans.
The mission of the navy traditionally consists of ensuring that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to support Great Britain.
Simultaneously, the German Navy attempted to stop this traffic, mainly with U-boats.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been in a position to conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
Geese were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
All cultures and peoples have kept livestock for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Geese were traditionally kept in flocks on slopes or rough pastureland, often cared for by goose herders who were frequently children and adolescents, similar to the well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Rabbit warrens were already built in England in the 16th century.
Although cobblestone roads mainly consisted of parallel wooden beams, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to keep the rails in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron staff on top.
That became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden rails were replaced by iron rails. In 1767, the first full steel rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking; people began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (upright man).
Her predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as commonly believed.
Evidence of bipedalism is found in fossils of *Australopithecus* dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although *Sahelanthropus* may have already walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
That is often like a symptomatic treatment. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should overcome them.
It is clear enough that the scientific and technological advancements of humanity have strongly changed the world, and the problems have become bigger due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humanity.
After it was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4th, one handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks further to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
It was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides, of which we know they still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The handwritten original copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things with birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary digit can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these digits are considered binary digits – or bits (when using computer language).
A subtle poisoning is not likely to be immediately detectable. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, you will find specific first aid instructions for the respective poison.
The term "Kiewerlek" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are very strongly adapted to parasitize humans.
Bed bugs and boxelder bugs are nocturnal creatures that have adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may therefore decide that it is not in their best interest – or that of their child – to raise a large family.
This couple can decide to make an adoption plan for their puppy.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method. This method undoubtedly underlies the vast majority of scientific research.
However, they don't do that alone; experimenting – and an experiment is a test that is carried out to confirm or refute one or more possible hypotheses – asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrate on classical texts, and particularly on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Success in physiology and behavior observing rhythms often crucially depends on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that continue to run for a time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading proofs that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, one of which labeled the phage’s DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other of which labeled the phage’s protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns and villages by car to get to work, passing those whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy steered one of the stable states of the biosphere that supported the evolution of humankind over the last 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In industrial countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, as the behaviour of the driver cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally stay within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly mathematically modeled.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships between the three main properties were established: (1) Flow, (2) Density and (3) Speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings flat against their bodies.
That offers them a larger range of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, mayflies and one-day flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but thankfully those people were proven wrong; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, in places almost 9.7 kilometers wide.
Full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical achievement of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
Those ancient Egyptians from the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Even in antiquity, people knew fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and extracted relatively easily with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more than the four states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma; although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, metals such as silver and gold also exist.
They also contain admixtures with small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many people, as it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil is becoming less important and used with the development of new writing methods.
People now write messages on computer screens and no longer need fountain pens.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to hold together a cell nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy stone up a hill. The renewed division of the cell nucleus then releases part of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay with little or no prompting.
The Moon's surface consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called regolith.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and approximately 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the meadows and thicker over the plateau.
There could be more craters on the sunward side, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out how people tick or what motivates them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been frustrated as they have entered adulthood.
Considering this theory, what it has to do with certain people who want the things they want, and how things in their environment lead them to wanting or not wanting certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two approaches can emerge when managers start leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain ‘one of the colleagues’ (or colleagues).
This type of leadership struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the boss is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This story often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as sounding boards for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to the respective time zones, which is not necessarily understood by local management.
The wisdom of a true 'invisible team' (Larson & LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which every individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively within the functional areas of a company, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that serves the needs of clients.
For an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge, as well as organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the research field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It is long known that various types of brain differences, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
That provides us with valuable information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong association with science fiction, AI constitutes a very important field of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research encompasses the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include steering, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have evolved into separate disciplines that focus on offering solutions to real problems.
AI systems are often used today in the fields of economics, medicine, technology and the military, but are also built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips constitute a large part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is a good opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is rebuilt every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a collection album.
Blogging can also help to improve student writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve their writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also compels students to become more familiar with the world around them." The necessity of gaining the public's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Frequent use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments from others and also emphasize their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north is the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more lift Ontario above what foreigners consider typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that might surprise many: there are more African Americans in the USA than Canadians.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself when it comes to flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or connected to France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European expansion and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel zone, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that travelling women state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a tie (but not one that looks too expensive).
Travellers should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they might perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Don't be shy when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences notwithstanding, it's not right either way!).
The ancient city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berbers and used as a strategic port named Anfa by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the old town of Medina, you easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a plethora of carpets are sold, but that’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the region of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the city centre.
While Goma appears relatively calm, all visits outside of Goma should be assessed to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorbike taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” became a figurative representation for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important locations during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS Special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, as it has more of an Arabian than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park extends over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each providing habitat for distinct wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park here as well.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place many tourists consider the main focus.
The pattern of the buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline was compared to a shimmering bar chart, made distinct by the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront promenade.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists staked their claim, and if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending from the coast over 80 km (50 miles) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. That part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the Sundarbans are not only mangrove forests – they encompass some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once stretched across the Ganges Delta.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and over 30,000 axis deer in the area.
Buses run all day from the Interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
As district-spanning buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a tied-arch bridge. It stretches over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two bridges rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two track gauges of 3.5 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, once the Brazilian customs control is likely to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group who lived in present-day Paraguay and as semi-nomadic hunters, also practicing subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was the homeland of another group of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The River Province of the Indies," was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
For the Spanish, the age of colonization began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has preserved a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polofelder in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and players can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check with the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value corresponds to that of a British pound (GBP).
They can only be exchanged at the single bank on the islands, which is opposite the 'FIC West' business in Stanley.
The British pound is normally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the more remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and US currency are accepted; check in advance with the owners what an acceptable payment method is.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than what the thermometer says.
There is no distinct "rainy" and "dry" season: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although these animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife remains wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you should maintain a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how tame they seem, bison, moose, deer, bears and as well as all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; so please give them their space.
In addition to this, you should be aware that foxes, bears and other wild animals are attracted by scents, so avoid wearing or cooking strongly smelling foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa with just under 40,000 inhabitants. It is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the highest-ranking chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's two harbours. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They went for a walk on the sandy beach, where one can swim safely, and most offer shade through Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour and the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are often crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
There are two local beers, the most important being 'Number One', it’s not a complex beer, but pleasant and rewarding; the other is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but New Zealand and Australian wines might get there more easily.
The local tap water is definitely safe to drink, but mineral water is readily available if you don't feel confident.
For Australians, the idea of a 'Flat White' coffee is exotic. A short black coffee is called 'Espresso', cappuccino has a dollop of whipped cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The warm cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the cliffs are made throughout the year and injuries due to one of these causes on the cliffs are rare.
Despite everything, ask the authorities for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish have been arriving on beaches and river mouths from October to April since 1770. Occasionally, they are also found outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
When booked in advance, the traveler can be completely reassured that they will be able to sleep soundly when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include coffee, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g., a visa).
Changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the middle of the action, you have to get up early to get a campsite near the music.
Please note that even when the music stops on the main stage, there may still be areas of the festival playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have specially designated camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern North Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as driving through ice can cause quite gruesome comedies for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos generally go to great lengths to maximize the time clients spend and the money they wager. Windows and clocks are typically absent, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and on the property.
Some venues offer alcoholic drinks on the house. But alcohol impairs judgement and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Everyone traveling at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can’t drive as you would on cobblestones.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time for it to stick.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling or blown snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to overland journeys to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and standard equipment enables good visibility.
Lynx, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a spotting scope.
A hiking safari (other designations are "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "on foot") consists of hikes, lasting either a few hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in various locations across Japan.
Tokyo is becoming the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, after already hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, then you likely have a tricky situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but since the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies no longer apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 ¥.
Stretching wet clothes can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if you are not in your room.
If a sock stretcher isn’t available, or you don’t feel like wearing stretched socks, you could try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which could cause it to ignite or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for water purification, some of which are more effective against specific contaminants.
In some areas, water needs to be boiled for a minute, while in others, several minutes are necessary.
Filters have varying effectiveness, and if you should have concerns, then you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in specific locations.
Travellers who travel to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently leads through remote forests.
If you're going to be driving on country roads after winning it, keep your wits about you: steep climbs, narrow lanes and sharp turns await.
The indicated speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections – usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph) – and it is even more important to adhere to them than usual.
Apparently, the mobile service here is much stronger than along other stretches, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite plentiful and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are everyday fare; apples are baked into pastries throughout the year, and plums and damsons are added in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're looking for small but rich pastries, try what is offered depending on the region as a Berliner, pancake, or donut.
A curry is a dish based on spices and herbs, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary from "dry" to "a soup" depending on its liquid content.
In the banner regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a large selection of regional cuisines from across the nation.
When used without further indication, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the dominant flavours of Javanese cuisine being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns, as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
When a rider is thrown from a horse, but a foot remains caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged along if the horse bolts. To reduce this risk, various safety precautions can be taken.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety stirrups that allow a rider to fall free from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling horse.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and rocks.
The summits offer breathtaking views from the peaks. Mountaineers from all over the world continuously find new routes between the endless potential of the walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve gliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to one's feet.
Sailing is an important recreational activity with many enthusiasts, who are sometimes also called "sailing fanatics" and plan their entire vacations around sailing in a specific location.
The idea of seafaring is very old – cave paintings depicting ships date back to around 5000 BC!
The origins of skiing as a sport date back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians and Australians.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also called ski touring, ski mountaineering, or snowshoeing.
It is related to that, but is not usually associated with alpine-style tours or mountaineering, the latter of which takes place on high-altitude terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski slope as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances by roller skiing than on foot – but you will only rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through more countries would mean having to apply for several visas and go through passport controls.
The Schengen Area functions in this respect similarly to a country.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Fortunately, with a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of when handmade items become antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, whereby the age limit in countries like North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many in connection with other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sami were heavily involved in reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, keeping reindeer largely as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi people and modern craftspeople work. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Although it is widespread, especially among non-Roma, the word "Zigeuner" (gypsy) is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and the inaccurate perception of Roma.
If the country you want to visit is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you would also like to take the advice of other governments besides your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Briefings are no more than a short summary of the political situation in a country.
The widely circulated opinions are often superficial, general, and, compared to the meanwhile otherwise available more detailed information, oversimplified.
Disaster is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of human life.
Floods can occur everywhere in the world and there are different types, which can depend on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and whirlwinds.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are often advised to be aware of the risk of inclement weather that may occur in their area, as it can affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
When searching the internet for a 'hostile environmental course', the address of a local company seemingly appears.
A course typically covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually combined with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing and a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications that address war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports where gender is not indicated (X) or to update documents to reflect a changed surname or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents varies greatly.
Searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive since the time after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to pass through the scanner and have their privacy and dignity remain intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow of waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections and a fast current can form there into the deep water.
Most fatalities are the result of exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to come back at a time when you won't be rescued again, or depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, it might be advisable to wait for rescue.
The reentry shock hits earlier and more intensely than culture shock (has less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be difficult.
Travellers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.
When you return from a stay abroad, you have adjusted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travellers need to adjust to a new country.
People likely don't expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
The Pyramid Town and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in peace before the show starts.
Normally, you always hear the hustle and bustle of tourists and merchants. The story of sound and light is like a fairytale book.
The Sphinx is considered the backdrop and narrator of a long tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among them are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The citizens of the peninsula merge here with the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which were split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as it needs to be used outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make calls.
The service is often used by shipping, including sports boats, as well as expeditions that require external data and speech recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you further information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year abroad is to travel and learn.
That is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In some cases, deregistering for a year abroad can actually improve your chances of higher education when you return home.
Normally, study fees apply to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful excursion destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has several thousand islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelago and the islands.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats or simply a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, typically with a boat for seven to eight people.
That can be found in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., the number is one in forty in the Netherlands).
Most of the various Baltic cruises offer a longer stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days while sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises advertise with Berlin (Germany) in their brochures. However, as you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located by the sea and the cruise price does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It’s nothing to get upset about: it doesn’t differ from the personal fears and prejudices that many other people have towards other things.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear of the unknown or of having no control.
Courier companies are well-paid to deliver items quickly. Often, time is critical with business documents, goods, or replacement parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it became a problem.
For items shipped by air freight, it could take days on some routes before everything was unloaded and cleared customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as unaccompanied baggage. Airline regulations don't allow you to ship baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious benefit of flying in first or business class is shelling out a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, having your company pay for it).
But that doesn’t come cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times as much as for Business class and eleven times as much as for First Class!
Generally, it doesn't make sense to even look for discounts on Business or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain core of travellers – those who, for the privilege of quickly and comfortably getting there, are prepared to pay a lot of dollars – and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey, with around 3.7 million inhabitants, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna, is today a modern, developed and bustling trading center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centres are interspersed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík, with a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, boasts an extraordinary octagonal church.
At the cemetery, there are interesting sandstone sculptures of doves on some graves.
It's worth taking a half-hour stroll through the fascinating village.
In the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous for foreigners after a celebratory depiction of its splendour was recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra and stops in Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the important sanctuary of Fátima (shrine), a world-renowned place for Marian apparitions.
Keep in mind that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has an almost incalculable significance for another part of the world’s population.
Many men and women still live who have outlived their time here, and many more who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Treat the Site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching the structure with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the people speak Catalan, a very large proportion understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are only indicated in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Despite this, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced through an automated system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, superficial and arrogant.
Although this is often an unfair stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to present your best self and behave like a person who is “well-bred” (well-mannered). It simplifies everything considerably.
That abrupt behaviour of the Parisians quickly fades if you are a little polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests – especially beeches, spruces and pines – and displays a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It boasts a remarkably large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the lynx, the wildcat, and the capercaillie can be found there, together with many other species.
During the visit to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go below the knees, and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a cloak for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a colorful one, you will be greeted with a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
People who need to box must fall over their knees.
And you can borrow that from the stand at the entrance, but the jumpsuits aren't washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable putting them on. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar zones in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple, popular evening snack, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All main words, except for the word 'Sie' for 'Dir', always begin with a capital letter, even mid-sentence.
That is a very important opportunity to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
And it simplifies reading, although the writing is a little complicated due to the necessity of figuring out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Make sure you pronounce the 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means 'dear', but 'carro' means 'car'.
Persian has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Here, the lessons from this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It has to be said that if you know a Romance language, it becomes easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak little Spanish may mistakenly conclude that Portuguese is close enough and therefore doesn't need to be studied separately.
Outdated observatories are usually sealed off today and preserved as museums or educational sites.
Although light pollution wasn't as much of a problem in its heyday as it is today, they were usually located in cities or on campuses and were easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, called Hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the Emperor held the first cherry blossom viewing parties exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" specimen away.
If you visit a formally maintained garden, you will be asked to leave without discussion if you collect "specimens".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to live, and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
However, as it is located in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you must cope with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less frequent).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Mud baths can be a good theme to plan a vacation around.
You could, for example, visit the castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to interesting places on the Danube, or a boat tour on the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers and in Christian countries, as well as by non-Christians all over the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at an exposed point to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could quite easily be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday during the Easter weekend, where communities often celebrate the resurrection of Christ precisely at midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew, or drifted ashore on the water.
Due to the great distance to the continent, mammals were unable to reach the islands, making the giant prickly pear cactus the first terrestrial plant in the Galapagos.
Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including geese, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you are also able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and more formal than what people from the West are used to.
Costumes are standard business attire and employees address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes celebrating the group's efforts rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain approval from their supervisor for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their supervisor's instructions without asking questions.
